=== VISUAL DESIGN ===

Color Scheme:
- Deep space black background
- Realistic planet colors based on actual data
- Blue/cyan UI elements for contrast
- White/yellow for Sun
- Green for scanner indicators
- Red for warnings

Planet Rendering:
- Mercury: Gray/brown
- Venus: Yellowish with thick atmosphere
- Earth: Blue/green with clouds
- Mars: Reddish-orange
- Jupiter: Orange/brown bands
- Saturn: Pale yellow with rings
- Uranus: Cyan/blue-green
- Neptune: Deep blue
- Pluto: Brown/gray

Scale Considerations:
- Real sizes would make planets invisible
- Use logarithmic scaling for visibility
- Option to toggle "realistic scale" vs "visible scale"
- Distances: Use AU for outer planets, km for inner system

=== PHYSICS SIMULATION ===

Update Loop (60 FPS):
1. Calculate time delta
2. Update all celestial body positions using orbital mechanics
3. Update probe position based on velocity and gravity
4. Check for collisions/landings
5. Update camera position
6. Render scene
7. Update UI

Orbital Calculation:
- Pre-calculate orbital parameters for each body
- Use Kepler's equation to find position at current time
- Apply 3D rotation matrices for inclination and node
- Cache calculations when time warp is active

Gravity Simulation:
- Calculate gravitational force from nearby bodies
- F = G * m1 * m2 / r²
- Apply to probe velocity
- Sphere of influence for dominant body

=== PROGRESSION SYSTEM ===

Starting Scenario:
- Probe starts near Earth
- Tutorial prompts guide first actions
- Initial objective: Reach the Moon

Milestones:
- Visit all planets
- Visit all major moons
- Discover all dwarf planets
- Complete gravity assist maneuver
- Land on 10 different bodies
- Scan entire solar system

Science Activities:
- Scan: Reveals basic data (mass, diameter, composition)
- Map: Records surface features (requires orbit)
- Land: Collects surface samples (requires solid surface)
- Photograph: Takes screenshot with metadata
