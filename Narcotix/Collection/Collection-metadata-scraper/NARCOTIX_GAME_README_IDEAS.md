## 🎯 Expression Rarity & Game Balance

| Expression       | Count | Rarity Tier   | Color   | Archetype            |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| X( Compassion    | 527   | **Common**    | #9900ff | Healing/Buff         |
| X) Joy           | 523   | **Common**    | #ff00ff | Movement/Cheer       |
| X] Disorder      | 510   | **Common**    | #38761d | Chaos/Damage         |
| ...              | ...   | ...           | ...     | ...                  |
| XB Cryptoanarchy | 26    | **Rare**      | #b4a7d6 | Hacking/Tactics      |
| XJ Machiavelian  | 21    | **Epic**      | #999999 | Stealth/Infiltration |

| XBitcoin         | 1     | **Mythic**    | #d4b351 | Ultimate Power       |

* **Common (500+ pills)** – basic, balanced abilities
* **Uncommon (100–500)** – moderate perks
* **Rare (20–100)** – strong tactical options
* **Epic (5–30)** – major strategic tools
* **Legendary & Mythic (<5)** – game-changing mechanics

## 🧪 Mechanics: Faction Setup & Per-Run Choices

1. **Run Start: Faction Select**

   * You pick one expression faction from your collection.
   * Your **active faction** defines your *core loadout, abilities,* and *starting area*.

2. **Faction Power by Pill Count**

   * Strength scales with count:

     * 1 pill → Tier 1 ability
     * 3 pills → Tier 2 (cooler ammo, faster regen)
     * 5 pills → Tier 3 (ultimate ability unlocked)
     * 10+ pills → +30% buff across the board
   * Common factions need many for Tier 3; Rare/Legendary need fewer—keeping pace across rarities.

3. **Passive “Silent” Faction Buffs**

   * Other factions in your inventory grant minor passive perks:

     * *Joy*: +5% move speed
     * *Disorder*: +5% crit chance
     * *XStacks*: +2% chance for warp-pick during exploration

4. **Faction-Specific Weapons & Abilities**

   * **Common**: basic weapons (tranq, burst-fire pistols)
   * **Rare/Epic**: specialized tools (teleport grenades, hacking drones)
   * **Legendary/Mythic**: “ultimate” pills:

     * *XStacks*: reality-bend field – slow time + bullet reflect
     * *XBitcoin*: universal currency hack – free items from vendors

## 🔄 Level & Loot Design (Roguelike Flow)

* Procedural zones tailored to faction tiers ([YouTube][1], [Wikipedia][2], [Steam Community][3]).

  * Tier 1: Normal districts
  * Tier 3: Locked labs, requires Tier 3 access
  * Mythic zone: one-of-a-kind challenges or boss with high-value rewards
* Loot and pill drops match rarity tiers—common zones yield common pills, etc.

---

## 🎯 Run Objectives & Scaling

* Each run has roguelike objectives:

  * Clear 10 zones, collect “essence” fragments
  * Complete faction-themed quests (e.g., *“As Machiavelian, infiltrate HQ undetected”*)
* Permanent unlocks after successful run:

  * New pill recipes
  * Meta shortcuts (akin to roguelite permanent perks) ([Steam Community][3])

---

## 🤼 Faction Conflicts & PvP

* PvP arenas or NPC zone guards favor/disfavor factions based on the zone:

  * In *Joy Plaza*, Joy players get +20% crit
  * In *Crypto Alley*, Cryptoanarchy unlocks secret trade routes

---

## 🧬 Fusion & Crafting

* Combine pills to create hybrids:

  * **Common+Common** → Uncommon
  * **Common+Rare** → Epic
  * **Rare+Legendary** → Mythic
* Always consume source pills—a strategic decision based on rarity value.

---

## 🔁 Loop Recap

1. **Start run** → Loadout & buff based on faction & count
2. **Run zones** with progressive difficulty & faction synergy
3. **Loot, craft, fuse** to build new pills mid-run
4. **Complete objective** → end run → earn meta-unlocks
5. **Repeat with new possibilities**

---

### ✅ Why This Works

* **Rarity ensures balance**: powerful factions need fewer pills; common factions need investment.
* **Resource management** mimics roguelike risk/reward ([Steam Community][3], [Wikipedia][4]).
* **Faction variety + hidden synergy** keeps gameplay fresh and strategic.
* **Permanent progression** provides long-term goals without breaking permadeath tension ([Steam Community][3]).

This layered design blends bullet-hell action, roguelike progression, and comedic pill lore into a memorable core experience. Let me know if you'd like detailed pseudocode for fusion, faction buffs, or loot generation!
