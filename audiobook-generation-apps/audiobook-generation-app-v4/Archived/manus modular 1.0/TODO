PLease review my code and explain how it will currently handle manuscripts that are input in
▌ different languages. Then work out if we need to update the code to handle different languages in
▌ terms of identifying new chapters. If we do, please work out the most efficient and simplest
▌ update to implement a language checker that can ensure that the code will operate correctly when
▌ generating text from manuscrpits in foreign languages.
