Prompts to run:

PLease review my code and explain how it will currently handle manuscripts that are input in
▌ different languages. Then work out if we need to update the code to handle different languages in
▌ terms of identifying new chapters. If we do, please work out the most efficient and simplest
▌ update to implement a language checker that can ensure that the code will operate correctly when
▌ generating text from manuscrpits in foreign languages.



▌ Please add more logging to give regular updates and progress reports and visuals to show users
▌ what is happening, how the chapter is being processed, what stage we are at how far through the
▌ full chapter and full book process are we so there is more obvious activity going on when things
▌ are progressing as normal.



Future updates

Some chapter safety checks to ensure corect order is maintained and each chapter must be successfully chunked then formed into a full chapter mp3 file before moving to process the next chapter.
