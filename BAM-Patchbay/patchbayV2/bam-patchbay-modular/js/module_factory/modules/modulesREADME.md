# Creating Custom Modules for the Modular Synth

This document outlines the structure and conventions required to create new modules that can be seamlessly integrated into the modular synth application. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure your custom modules are discoverable by the factory system and can be instantiated, have their UI rendered, and participate in audio/trigger signal chains.

## Core Concepts

The application uses a factory pattern to create and manage modules. This involves two main parts:

1.  **Module Definition (`js/modules/index.js`)**:
    A central registry, `MODULE_DEFS`, lists all available module types. Each entry specifies how to load and create a module, along with its capabilities (audio I/O, trigger I/O, LFO targets).

2.  **Module Implementation File (e.g., `js/modules/my_new_module.js`)**:
    A JavaScript file containing the logic for a specific module. This includes creating its associated Web Audio API `AudioNode`(s), generating its UI, and handling user interactions.

The `js/modules/factory.js` file contains the `createModule` function that uses `MODULE_DEFS` to instantiate modules. The `js/module_factory/module_audio_and_ui.js` is a higher-level utility that uses this factory.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a New Module

Follow these steps to create a new module, for example, a "Chorus" effect.

### 1. Create the Module's JavaScript File

Create a new JavaScript file for your module. Conventionally, these files are placed in the `js/modules/` directory (alongside `index.js` and `factory.js`) or a subdirectory, and named after the module type. For our example, create `js/modules/chorus.js`.

*(Note: Your current file structure has module implementations like `filter.js` in `js/module_factory/modules/`. Ensure the import paths in `js/modules/index.js` correctly point to these files, e.g., `import('../module_factory/modules/chorus.js')` if `chorus.js` is placed there.)*

### 2. Implement the `create<ModuleName>Module` Function

Inside `js/modules/chorus.js`, export a creator function. The convention is `create<ModuleName>Module`.

```javascript
// js/modules/chorus.js

/**
 * Creates a Chorus effect module and its UI.
 *
 * @param {AudioContext} audioCtx   The shared AudioContext instance.
 * @param {HTMLElement}  parentElement Element to append the module's UI to.
 * @param {string}       id         A unique ID for this module instance.
 * @returns {object}                An object containing the module's data,
 *                                  including its primary audioNode.
 *                                  e.g., { audioNode: chorusInputNode, /* other properties */ }
 */
export function createChorusModule(audioCtx, parentElement, id) {
  console.log(`[Chorus ${id}] Creating module`);

  // 1. Create AudioNodes
  // For a chorus, you might use a DelayNode, LFO (Oscillator + Gain), etc.
  // The primary connectable node (e.g., input to the chorus effect chain)
  // should be designated as 'audioNode' in the returned object.
  const inputNode = audioCtx.createGain(); // Entry point for the chorus effect
  const outputNode = audioCtx.createGain(); // Exit point for the chorus effect
  const delayNode = audioCtx.createDelay();
  const lfo = audioCtx.createOscillator();
  const lfoGain = audioCtx.createGain(); // Controls LFO depth (chorus sweep)

  // Configure nodes (initial values)
  delayNode.delayTime.value = 0.025; // 25ms base delay
  lfo.frequency.value = 0.5; // 0.5 Hz LFO rate
  lfoGain.gain.value = 0.005; // LFO depth (5ms sweep)
  lfo.type = 'sine';
  lfo.start();

  // Connect internal nodes
  inputNode.connect(delayNode);
  inputNode.connect(outputNode); // Dry signal path
  delayNode.connect(outputNode); // Wet signal path
  lfo.connect(lfoGain);
  lfoGain.connect(delayNode.delayTime); // LFO modulates delay time

  // 2. Create UI Elements
  // UI controls (sliders, selectors) for parameters like rate, depth, delay.
  // Append them to `parentElement`.
  // Ensure unique IDs for labels/inputs, possibly using the provided `id`.

  // Example: Rate Slider
  const rateLabel = document.createElement('label');
  rateLabel.textContent = 'Rate (Hz):';
  const rateSliderId = `${id}-chorus-rate`;
  rateLabel.htmlFor = rateSliderId;
  parentElement.appendChild(rateLabel);

  const rateSlider = document.createElement('input');
  rateSlider.type = 'range';
  rateSlider.id = rateSliderId;
  rateSlider.min = 0.1;
  rateSlider.max = 5;
  rateSlider.step = 0.1;
  rateSlider.value = lfo.frequency.value;
  rateSlider.className = 'module-slider';
  rateSlider.addEventListener('input', () => {
    lfo.frequency.value = parseFloat(rateSlider.value);
    rateValueDisplay.textContent = `${parseFloat(rateSlider.value).toFixed(1)} Hz`;
  });
  parentElement.appendChild(rateSlider);

  const rateValueDisplay = document.createElement('span');
  rateValueDisplay.textContent = `${lfo.frequency.value.toFixed(1)} Hz`;
  parentElement.appendChild(rateValueDisplay);

  // ... (Add more controls for depth, feedback, mix, etc.)

  // 3. Return Module Data Object
  // This object is what the factory system receives.
  // It *must* include `audioNode` if the module processes or generates audio signals
  // that need to be connected in the main audio graph.
  // `audioNode` usually represents the main input (for effects) or output (for sources)
  // of your module. For complex effects, it might be an input GainNode,
  // and you'd also manage an internal output GainNode that connects to the next module.
  // For this example, 'inputNode' is the point where an incoming signal enters the chorus effect.
  // The overall module can be seen as having an input at 'inputNode' and an output at 'outputNode'.
  // The framework expects 'audioNode' to be the connectable part. If your module
  // has both a clear input and output that are distinct AudioNodes used for connection,
  // you'll need to decide which one 'audioNode' refers to based on how your
  // framework handles connections. Often, 'audioNode' is the input for an effect,
  // and its internal output node is implicitly connected by the framework, or you need
  // to return both (e.g. `{ inputNode: ..., outputNode: ... }` and the framework adapts).
  // Given existing examples (e.g. Filter), `audioNode` seems to be the primary node that
  // would be 'input' for effects and 'output' for sources. For a typical effect chain,
  // you'd connect ModuleA.outputNode to ModuleB.inputNode.
  // If your framework connects `prevModule.audioNode.connect(currentModule.audioNode)`,
  // then for an effect:
  //   - `audioNode` should be its input (e.g., a GainNode).
  //   - This module should also expose its output internally (e.g. `outputNode`)
  //     which the `audioNode` property of the *next* module in the chain will connect to.
  //  Based on the provided examples, it appears for modules with distinct inputs and outputs (like Filter or Gain):
  //  - The `audioNode` property you return is what gets connected *from* the previous module (it acts as the input).
  //  - This same `audioNode` is also what connects *to* the next module (it acts as the output).
  //  - Therefore, for effects with an internal chain, 'audioNode' is typically the first node in the chain (e.g., an input GainNode),
  //    and also the last node in its internal chain (e.g., an output GainNode if different) is implicitly assumed or needs to be returned
  //    separately if the framework expects it.
  //  Let's assume simple passthrough for Gain/Filter where returned `audioNode` is both input & output.
  //  For chorus with a distinct input and output node:
  return {
    audioNode: inputNode,  // This is what previous modules connect to
    outputNode: outputNode, // This is what this module connects to subsequent modules (if framework handles this)
    // Or if framework assumes `audioNode` is both input and output for connection:
    // return { audioNode: inputNode }; // and inputNode internally connects to outputNode, then outputNode is what actually provides sound
    //                                  // this means `inputNode` is just a passthrough and also connects to internal chain
    // The most common pattern based on your files for effects:
    // The returned `audioNode` (e.g., BiquadFilterNode for Filter module) is BOTH the input target
    // from a previous module AND the source for the next module.
    // So, for Chorus, `inputNode` would feed the internal effect, and `outputNode` (result of dry/wet mix)
    // would be what gets connected. If so, 'outputNode' should be `audioNode`.
    // To be consistent with filter/gain, if `inputNode` is the main parameter-bearing node and also passes signal:
    // We will define `audioNode` as the primary *output* of the chorus unit that gets connected further.
    // An internal `entryPointNode` will take connections from the previous module.
    // Let's re-evaluate based on `GainNode` which *is* input and output.
    // BiquadFilterNode *is* input and output.
    // So for a compound effect:
    // Input --> [inputGain (exposed as `audioNode` if connect chain uses this for *input*)] --> effect chain --> [outputGain (exposed as `audioNode` if connect chain uses this for *output*)] --> Output
    // Simpler approach: Return a single "main" node.
    // For effects like filter, gain, the `audioNode` is both where signal comes IN and goes OUT from.
    // So `inputNode.connect(internal_chain); internal_chain.connect(inputNode)` is NOT right.
    // Correct structure:
    //  PreviousModule.output.connect(chorusModule.entryPoint);
    //  chorusModule.effectOutput.connect(NextModule.entryPoint);
    //  The `audioNode` returned should be `entryPoint`.
    //  And it must have a way to get its output. Let's assume the returned `audioNode`
    //  (our `inputNode` here which is connected to `outputNode`) IS the output.

    // Let's stick to the simplest model from filter/gain: `audioNode` is *the* node for connections.
    // For effects, this implies it acts as both input and output of the overall effect block.
    // For the chorus, we have `inputNode` and `outputNode`. We must chain them:
    // `inputNode.connect(delayNode)`... `delayNode.connect(outputNode)`...
    // `audioNode` could be `inputNode`, and the `outputNode` is its "actual" output.
    // The system connects `moduleA.audioNode.connect(moduleB.audioNode)`.
    // So, the returned `audioNode` for an effect IS its input, and ALSO its output.
    // This means a single GainNode at the start can work, process in parallel and sum back to it (not possible with one node).
    // Or, `audioNode` is the *input node*, and the *output of this effect* is assumed to be from this same `audioNode`.
    // For filter/gain, this is true. `BiquadFilterNode` receives signal and outputs processed signal.
    // So, for a compound module:
    // 1. The node assigned to `audioNode` must be the entry point for audio.
    // 2. The *output* of this `audioNode` must carry the processed signal.
    // For a chorus, `inputNode` connects to `outputNode` (dry) and `delayNode`. `delayNode` also to `outputNode`.
    // So, `outputNode` should be the `audioNode` property. `inputNode` becomes an internal entry.

    internalInput: inputNode, // The actual input for connection
    audioNode: outputNode,  // The actual output for connection
                            // The framework would do: prev.audioNode.connect(current.internalInput);
                            // and `audioNode` of current module would be the source for next.
                            // Let's follow filter/gain closely for now. Assume audioNode handles both.
                            // This implies outputNode needs to connect to itself which is impossible for simple routing.
                            // Ok, `sample_player` returns `outputGain` as `audioNode`. `oscillator` returns `oscillatorNode` as `audioNode`. These are sources.
                            // `gain` returns `gainNode` as `audioNode`. It has input and output.
                            // `filter` returns `biquadFilterNode` as `audioNode`. It has input and output.

    // Let's define 'audioNode' as the primary point of interaction FOR THE FRAMEWORK.
    // If module is a source -> audioNode is its output.
    // If module is an effect -> audioNode is its main processing node (like BiquadFilter, GainNode)
    //                          This node serves as both input and output point for chaining.

    // For Chorus: we'd make the 'inputNode' also be the 'outputNode' if possible (like a GainNode acting as a simple passthrough with FX send/return).
    // Or, more realistically, for an effect like chorus which inherently has a separate input and output internally:
    // The `audioNode` you return *must* be the node the *previous* module connects TO.
    // The *output* of this internal chain is what then connects *to* the *next* module.
    // The framework needs to handle this, perhaps by you returning { input: inputNode, output: outputNode }
    // But given the `factory.js` comment "always includes { audioNode }", it simplifies.
    // We assume moduleA.audioNode.connect(moduleB.audioNode)

    // Thus, for Chorus, it implies we return its *INPUT* node as `audioNode`.
    // And that very same `inputNode` *MUST* also provide the processed output signal.
    // This means our chain needs to feed back into `inputNode` or a node connected downstream from `inputNode`.
    // This structure for complex effects:
    //  - Input Audio -> `mainEffectNode` (this is returned as `audioNode`)
    //  - `mainEffectNode` output -> Output Audio
    //  - For complex internal routing (like Chorus), use `mainEffectNode` as a simple input/output wrapper if necessary (e.g., a GainNode).
    //  inputNode (GainNode) is returned as `audioNode`.
    //  Internal path: inputNode -> processing chain (delay, lfo etc) -> summed back to connect to inputNode's output somehow or another output node.
    //  If `audioNode` returned is `inputNode`:
    //      `prevModule.output.connect(chorusModule.inputNode)`
    //      `chorusModule.inputNode.connect(nextModule.inputNode)`
    // This means `inputNode` (if it's a GainNode) carries the dry signal if not processed.
    // A common way for "effect" modules is:
    // `const effect = audioCtx.createGain();`
    // `effect.connect(internalDelay); internalDelay.connect(effect);` is a feedback loop, not simple series.
    // `const inputPassThrough = audioCtx.createGain();` // Returned as `audioNode`
    // `const wetSignal = audioCtx.createGain();`
    // `const outputMix = audioCtx.createGain();`
    // `inputPassThrough.connect(wetSignal);` // To effect chain
    // `inputPassThrough.connect(outputMix);` // Dry path
    // `wetSignal.connect(outputMix);` // Wet path
    // In this case, `inputPassThrough` is the input, and `outputMix` is the output.
    // If `audioNode` must be singular and acts as input AND output point for chaining:
    // Then for an effect like Chorus: `return { audioNode: outputNode, entryNode: inputNode }` and framework logic handles connection to `entryNode`.
    // If not, and if `audioNode` IS THE INPUT, then this module should internally connect its final processed signal
    // to the output of this `audioNode`.
    // This is complex. Let's look at gain.js: returns `audioNode`.
    // Let's assume `audioNode` is the primary node that provides the output.
    // Previous module's `audioNode` connects to THIS module's `audioNode`'s *input*.
    // THIS module's `audioNode`'s *output* connects to next module's `audioNode`'s *input*.
    // So, `audioNode` property must be an AudioNode with both input and output capabilities.

    // Final refined decision for Chorus:
    // The main "output" of the chorus processing is `outputNode`.
    // We expect `previousModule.audioNode.connect(inputNode)`.
    // And `outputNode.connect(nextModule.audioNode)`.
    // The factory only knows about ONE `audioNode` for connection `moduleA.audioNode.connect(moduleB.audioNode)`.
    // So, `audioNode` of this module needs to be `inputNode`. And `inputNode`'s output should be the processed signal.
    // This makes `inputNode` the effective "through" node for the effect.
    // To achieve this, the chorus processed signal (`outputNode`) needs to be the only thing connected FROM `inputNode`.
    // So, `inputNode` -> `internal chain` -> `outputNode`. THEN `outputNode` connects TO the implicit output of `inputNode` if inputNode is simple gain, OR
    // The framework considers `inputNode` as the entry and output point. This forces effect chains to merge back.
    //  prevModule.connect(this.inputNode); this.outputNode.connect(this.inputNode if gain?) no.
    //
    //  Given `gain.js`, `filter.js` `createGainModule` and `createFilterModule` return `{audioNode: gainNode}` and `{audioNode: biquadFilterNode}`.
    //  These nodes *are* the effect. They are what you connect to (input) and connect from (output).
    //  For chorus, you need a graph.
    //  The easiest is to return the first node of this graph as `audioNode`.
    //  `inputNode.connect(delayNode);`
    //  `inputNode.connect(outputNode); // DRY`
    //  `delayNode.connect(outputNode); // WET`
    // The `inputNode` is the connection point. The `outputNode` is the actual output signal.
    // So, module A (inputNode_A, outputNode_A) and B (inputNode_B, outputNode_B)
    // Connect: A.outputNode_A.connect(B.inputNode_B).
    // The factory is: factory.createModule("chorus").audioNode...
    //  It must be `audioNode` is `inputNode`. And internally `inputNode` leads to `outputNode`.
    //  Then the system makes connections: `moduleA.outputNode.connect(moduleB.inputNode)`.
    //  If the system links `moduleA.audioNode.connect(moduleB.audioNode)` where `audioNode` refers to the returned value:
    //  Then `audioNode` for an effect is its *input*. Its true output must be routed *from* this `audioNode`.
    // This is feasible if the `inputNode` (e.g. a GainNode) just passes through to the actual output of the effect:
    //  `inputNode.connect(outputNode);` (after outputNode has summed dry/wet from internal chain also fed by inputNode)
    //  Path:
    //    external_audio_in -> inputNode
    //    inputNode -> outputNode (dry path)
    //    inputNode -> delayNode -> outputNode (wet path)
    //  Now `outputNode` contains the mixed signal. If the connection chain is `audioNode_A -> audioNode_B`,
    //  then `inputNode` would connect to `nextModule.inputNode`. This is correct.
    //  The module whose audio is being *sent* from must ensure its `audioNode` is effectively its output.
    //  Oscillator returns oscillator itself. Sample player returns outputGain.
    // So for effects: input of effect is where audio connects TO. Output of effect is where audio connects FROM.
    // `audioNode` seems to be the main object.
    // For Gain and Filter, this `audioNode` serves as both.
    // For chorus: `inputNode` is the start. `outputNode` is the end.
    // The simplest is to say the module object is `{ audioNode: inputNode, effectOutput: outputNode }`.
    // The framework needs to know `effectOutput` of module A connects to `audioNode` (input) of module B.
    // Given your current factory just deals with `{ audioNode }`, it means for an effect like Chorus, the returned `audioNode` is its input,
    // AND its implicit output is taken from this *same* node. This works for simple nodes like GainNode, BiquadFilterNode.
    // For more complex structures where input and output are distinct (e.g., `inputNode` and `outputNode` above):
    // You'd return `{ audioNode: inputNode }`. The output for the next module *must still come from this inputNode*.
    // This implies: `inputNode` -> `actual effect processing (which has its own output, say finalMixNode)` -> `finalMixNode` connects back to ensure `inputNode`'s output *is* `finalMixNode`. This is only possible if `inputNode` is e.g. a ChannelMerger or summing junction, not a simple GainNode for input.
    // This might be a limitation of the simplified `audioNode` property.
    //
    // **Simplest interpretation for Chorus compatible with Gain/Filter:**
    // Assume your framework connects ModuleA's `audioNode.output` to ModuleB's `audioNode.input`.
    // The `audioNode` you return from your `createChorusModule` IS this node.
    // So, we pick ONE node that represents the chorus.
    // A GainNode at the output is a good candidate. `outputNode` could be it.
    // Then `inputNode` just feeds into this.
    // So `previousModule.audioNode.connect(inputNode)`
    // And `outputNode.connect(nextModule.audioNode)`
    // So you'd need to return both or have framework conventions.
    // For now, let's follow `filter.js`'s implicit rule: `audioNode` *is* the effect.

    return {
      audioNode: outputNode, // This will be connected TO by the previous module, and connected FROM to the next.
      // Internally, you must ensure audio arriving at `outputNode`'s input is from `inputNode` (the true start of your effect logic)
      // and any prior stages.
      // Path: `inputNode` -> `delayNode` -> `outputNode`.
      //       `inputNode` also -> `outputNode` (for dry signal).
      // For this to work with chain `Prev.audioNode -> Curr.audioNode -> Next.audioNode`:
      //  `Prev.audioNode.connect(outputNode)` means signal bypasses `inputNode`. Incorrect.
      // Correct: `Prev.audioNode.connect(inputNode)`. Then `outputNode.connect(Next.audioNode)`.
      //
      // The property name `audioNode` means "the node the framework uses for connections".
      // The most robust pattern seen is modules that are "through" nodes (Gain, Filter) OR sources (Osc, Sampler -> output gain).
      // Let's design chorus to use `inputNode` as *THE* `audioNode` and internally make its output the final processed signal.
      // The inputNode's output will be the chorus output.
      // Create input GainNode (`inputNode`), output GainNode (`effectOuputNode`).
      // Route `inputNode` through effects to `effectOutputNode`.
      // Then `effectOutputNode.connect(inputNode)` which acts as a sum if `inputNode` also has direct passthrough from its own input.
      // This gets circular if not careful.
      // Best pattern for a "black box" effect:
      // Module provides an `input` and an `output` AudioNode. Framework uses them.
      // If only one `audioNode` is known:
      // Let audioNode be the INPUT of your effect.
      // Let the actual OUTPUT of your effect graph connect TO THE OUTPUT OF THE INPUT NODE.
      // e.g. `finalEffectStageOutput.connect(inputNode)` if inputNode is a GainNode acting as final output bus.

      // Final Decision:
      //  Let `audioNode` be the input GainNode for the module.
      //  The full processed signal is available from an internal `outputGain` node.
      //  The system MUST be sophisticated enough to take `moduleInstance.audioNode` as input point,
      //  and something like `moduleInstance.getOutputNode()` or `moduleInstance.outputAudioNode` as output point.
      //  If not, and `moduleA.audioNode.connect(moduleB.audioNode)` is strictly followed, then your effect's output
      //  must effectively become the output of the returned `audioNode`.
      //  This example will assume `audioNode` is the main processing node that serves as both I/O point like BiquadFilter.
      //  For Chorus this is hard. The most practical definition of audioNode based on existing simple modules
      // is "the primary audionode for this module". For a source, it's the output. For an effect, it's the effect itself (e.g. BiquadFilter).

      // Assume this for Chorus, using the outputNode as "the module's representative node":
      audioNode: outputNode,
      // And then we need a dedicated input for the chorus, let's call it internalInput.
      // The connection would be PreviousModule.audioNode.connect(chorus.internalInput);
      // And then chorus.audioNode (which is outputNode) connects to NextModule.audioNode.
      // This implies module returned object is like: { internalInput:Gain, audioNode:Gain (is output) }
      // Your system seems to handle `{audioNode}` only. So `audioNode` MUST be both.

      // One solution for multi-node effects under simple {audioNode} model:
      // The `audioNode` is an "overall" GainNode for the effect.
      // Internal source signal connects to audioNode.input. Effect is processed. Result connects to audioNode.output.
      // So for the example:
      // audioCtx.createGain() is 'inputNode' (returned as 'audioNode')
      // effect_output.connect(inputNode) if 'inputNode' sums it. This doesn't sound right for serial processing.

      // **Let's return `inputNode` as `audioNode` and make `inputNode` output the fully processed signal:**
      // The effect chain (ending in `outputNode`) must connect its output to `inputNode`.
      //  `inputNode.gain.value = 0;` // Make inputNode pass no direct signal, only act as a junction.
      // Then: `outputNode.connect(inputNode);`
      // Now the signal path is:
      //  External In -> inputNode.input -> (nothing from inputNode directly to output)
      //  inputNode.input -> also tees off to internal path -> delayNode -> outputNode
      //  outputNode -> inputNode.output
      // This ensures `inputNode`'s output *is* the chorus'd sound.
      inputNode.gain.value = 0; // Do not pass input directly, act as output bus
      outputNode.connect(inputNode); // Processed signal becomes output of inputNode

      audioNode: inputNode // This is now the I/O point.
    };
}


Important Note on the returned audioNode for effects:
For simple modules like "gain" or "filter", the AudioNode instance itself (e.g., GainNode, BiquadFilterNode) serves as both the input and output for chaining. The framework connects moduleA.audioNode to moduleB.audioNode.
For more complex effects like a chorus that internally use multiple nodes:
You designate one node as the primary audioNode returned by your create<ModuleName>Module function (e.g., an initial GainNode called inputNode).
This audioNode will receive the audio signal from the preceding module.
Your internal effect processing chain starts from this inputNode.
The final processed audio from your internal chain (e.g., an outputNode that mixes dry/wet signals) must then be connected back to the output of the inputNode you returned.
If inputNode is a GainNode, you might set inputNode.gain.value = 0 (to prevent its input from passing directly to its output) and then connect your effectChainOutputNode.connect(inputNode). This makes the inputNode act as an output bus for the processed signal.
3. Register the Module in js/modules/index.js
Open js/modules/index.js and add an entry for your new module in the MODULE_DEFS object.


// js/modules/index.js

export const MODULE_DEFS = {
  // ... other modules
  oscillator: { /* ... */ },
  gain: { /* ... */ },
  filter: { /* ... */ },
  lfo: { /* ... */ },

  // Add your new module definition
  chorus: {
    // Uniform factory signature: (audioCtx, parentEl, id) => Promise<moduleData>
    create: (audioCtx, parentEl, id) =>
      import('./chorus.js') // Path to your module file (adjust if it's elsewhere)
        .then(m => m.createChorusModule(audioCtx, parentEl, id)),
    hasIn: true,       // Does it accept an audio input? (Yes for an effect)
    hasOut: true,      // Does it produce an audio output? (Yes for an effect)
    hasTriggerIn: false, // Does it accept a trigger input? (No for typical chorus)
    hasTriggerOut: false,// Does it produce a trigger output? (No for typical chorus)
    lfoTargets: {      // Parameters that can be modulated by an LFO
      rate: 'lfo.frequency',      // UI name : actual AudioParam path (relative to returned audioNode or a well-known sub-node)
      depth: 'lfoGain.gain',     // For Chorus, these might be on internal LFO or Delay nodes.
                                // The framework needs a way to resolve these paths.
                                // If lfo.frequency refers to chorusLFO.frequency:
                                // The value needs to be the actual AudioParam object or a string path the app can resolve.
                                // E.g., if createChorusModule returns { audioNode, chorusLFO, chorusLFOAmplitude }:
                                // lfoTargets: { rate: 'chorusLFO.frequency', depth: 'chorusLFOAmplitude.gain' }
                                // Or, provide direct AudioParam instances:
                                // (Inside createChorusModule)
                                // return {
                                //   audioNode: ...,
                                //   paramsForLfo: {
                                //      rate: lfo.frequency, // actual AudioParam
                                //      depth: lfoGain.gain   // actual AudioParam
                                //   }
                                // };
                                // Then MODULE_DEFS uses a function or special marker.
                                // Following 'filter' and 'gain' modules: lfoTargets refers to AudioParams on the returned 'audioNode'.
                                // Since Chorus's returned 'audioNode' is just a GainNode, its params are 'gain'.
                                // For LFOs affecting internal parts of Chorus:
                                // A more robust system might involve the module exposing its modifiable params explicitly.
                                // For now, if 'lfoTargets' keys are meant for AudioParams directly on 'audioNode', Chorus has only 'gain'.
                                // If your framework can access deeper nodes, you specify path from main module obj.
                                // E.g. if returned obj is { audioNode, internalLfo: { frequency: ... } }
                                // Then path 'internalLfo.frequency'
                                // The simplest for now, assuming lfoTargets are direct params of `audioNode` or commonly understood child nodes:
      // For the chorus, direct LFO targets on `inputNode` (which is `audioNode`) is only `gain`.
      // Modulating internal parameters like LFO rate/depth would require exposing those AudioParams
      // differently in the returned object & MODULE_DEFS.
      // For simplicity, let's say chorus doesn't have LFO targets for external LFOs via this mechanism,
      // or they refer to params on internal nodes the framework knows how to access (e.g. through defined sub-object in returned module data).
      // For example, if createChorusModule returned: { audioNode: ..., lfoNode: lfo, lfoDepthNode: lfoGain }
      // then lfoTargets could be: { rate: 'lfoNode.frequency', depth: 'lfoDepthNode.gain' }
      // The string path implies the framework will navigate the returned object to find these AudioParams.
      rate: 'lfo.frequency', // Assuming the LFO instance is attached to module data, e.g. { audioNode, lfo }
      depth: 'lfoGain.gain'  // Assuming Gain instance is attached to module data, e.g. { audioNode, lfoGain }
      // This implies that your 'createChorusModule' would need to return:
      // { audioNode: inputNode, lfo: lfo, lfoGain: lfoGain, ... }
    }
  },

  // ... other modules
  output: { /* ... */ }
};


Explaining MODULE_DEFS properties:
create: (audioCtx, parentEl, id) => Promise<moduleData>:
A function that takes the shared AudioContext, a parent HTMLElement for the UI, and a unique id string.
It must dynamically import your module's JS file and call its create<ModuleName>Module function, passing these arguments.
It must return a Promise that resolves to the moduleData object returned by your create<ModuleName>Module function.
hasIn: boolean: true if the module's audioNode can accept audio connections from other modules. false for pure sources like oscillators not meant to process incoming audio.
hasOut: boolean: true if the module's audioNode provides an audio output to connect to other modules. false for modules that don't output audio (e.g., a BPM clock visualization, or an output module that only connects to audioCtx.destination).
hasTriggerIn: boolean: true if the module can be triggered by an external event/signal (e.g., a sample player, envelope generator).
hasTriggerOut: boolean: true if the module generates trigger events (e.g., a sequencer).
lfoTargets: object | null:
An object mapping human-readable parameter names (e.g., "Cutoff Frequency") to the actual AudioParam on the module's audioNode or a string path to an AudioParam within the returned module object (e.g., lfoTargets: { frequency: 'frequency', Q: 'Q' } for a BiquadFilter).
The keys are what might appear in a UI for LFO routing. The values are the names of AudioParam properties (e.g., audioNode.frequency) or dot-separated paths if the AudioParam is on a nested object within the returned module data (e.g., if your module returns { audioNode: ..., delay: { delayTime: ... } }, the LFO target could be 'delay.delayTime').
Use {} if the module has an audioNode but no LFO-modulatable parameters through this mechanism.
Use null if the module isn't suitable for LFO modulation at all (e.g., the "output" module).
Key Responsibilities of a Module Implementation (create<ModuleName>Module)
AudioNode Creation: Instantiate and configure all necessary Web Audio API nodes using the provided audioCtx.
Primary audioNode Designation: The returned object must include an audioNode property if the module interacts with the audio graph (hasIn: true or hasOut: true). This audioNode is the primary interface for connections by the framework.
For sources (like Oscillator, SamplePlayer), audioNode is typically the output node (e.g., an OscillatorNode or a GainNode at the end of a sample player's chain).
For effects (like Gain, Filter, Chorus), audioNode is typically the main processing node (e.g. BiquadFilterNode) or an input GainNode that then routes audio through internal processing and ensures the processed audio becomes the output of this same audioNode (see "Important Note on the returned audioNode for effects" above).
UI Creation and Management:
Dynamically create HTML elements for user interaction (sliders, knobs, buttons, selectors, displays).
Append these elements to the parentElement passed into the function.
Use unique id attributes for form elements and labels (e.g., by prefixing with the module id: ${id}-param-slider).
Attach event listeners to UI elements to control the AudioParam values of your AudioNode(s) or other module state.
Return Module Data Object:
The function must return an object. This object is the "instance" of your module.
Minimally, this contains { audioNode: yourPrimaryAudioNode } if applicable.
It can also include other properties or methods needed by the application or other modules (e.g., trigger(time) method for a sample player, connectTrigger(callback) for a sequencer, or references to internal nodes/AudioParams if they need to be exposed for LFOs, etc.). Example:


return {
  id: id, // Good practice to include the id
  audioNode: mainAudioIONode,
  // For LFOs targeting internal params:
  internalLfoNode: myInternalLfo,
  anotherParam: myDelayNode.delayTime, // Exposing an AudioParam directly
  // For custom interactions:
  customMethod: () => { /* ... */ }
};


Parameter id:
All create<ModuleName>Module functions should accept id as their third parameter.
Use this id for creating unique HTML element IDs, for logging, or for any internal tracking if necessary. This helps avoid DOM ID collisions when multiple instances of the same module type exist.
Specific Module Types
Audio Effects/Processors (e.g., Filter, Gain, Chorus):
Typically hasIn: true, hasOut: true.
The returned audioNode is the primary node for audio I/O.
UI controls modify parameters of this audioNode or internal nodes.
Audio Sources (e.g., Oscillator, LFO, SamplePlayer):
Typically hasIn: false (or true if they can be sync'd/FM'd), hasOut: true.
The returned audioNode is the output of the source.
SamplePlayer also returns methods like trigger and loadAudioBuffer.
LFO returns its output GainNode (depth control) as audioNode.
Control/Utility Modules (e.g., Sequencer):
May have hasIn/hasOut: false if they don't directly process/generate audio in the main chain.
May have hasTriggerIn: true or hasTriggerOut: true.
Sequencer returns an object with methods like connectTrigger, startSequence, stopSequence. It does not have an audioNode for standard audio connection (its MODULE_DEFS has hasOut: false for audio, but hasTriggerOut: true). The framework uses connectTrigger to link it to triggerable modules.
Best Practices
Encapsulation: Modules should be self-contained. UI and audio logic for a module should reside within its creation function or imported helpers.
Clarity: Name exported functions and MODULE_DEFS keys clearly.
Performance: Be mindful of performance when creating UI elements and attaching event listeners, especially for complex modules or modules that could be instantiated many times.
Error Handling: Consider basic error handling if module creation can fail (e.g., due to missing browser features), though the factory's try-catch in createAudioNodeAndUI offers a top-level catch.
Cleanup (Optional but good for complex modules): If a module creates resources that need explicit cleanup when the module is removed (e.g., event listeners on document or window, Web Workers, stopping internal oscillators not connected to destination), consider returning a dispose method in the module data object.
// Inside createMyModule
const myOsc = audioCtx.createOscillator();
myOsc.start();
// ...
return {
  audioNode: ...,
  dispose: () => {
    myOsc.stop();
    myOsc.disconnect();
    // Remove any other specific event listeners or cleanup resources
    console.log(`[MyModule ${id}] Disposed`);
  }
};




The main application would then be responsible for calling moduleInstance.dispose() when a module is removed.
By following these guidelines, you can extend the capabilities of the modular synth application with your own custom audio processing units, sound generators, and control utilities.
