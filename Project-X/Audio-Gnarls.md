### Audio Gnarls

*Twisting sound into visible knots—then etching them forever on-chain.*

Audio Gnarls are a limited series of synth-driven oscilloscope NFTs inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Each piece begins with a custom patch of additive and FM oscillators whose waveforms are routed to a vintage-style XY oscilloscope. As the frequencies collide, the trace contorts—circles shear into squares, Lissajous curves coil into tangled loops—creating the very “gnarls” that give the collection its name: knots of light born from knots of sound.

#### Why they’re special

* **Visible Gnarl-Points:** Every token captures a single, unrepeatable moment when the waveform folds over itself, producing a knot-like inflection you can both *see* and *hear*.
* **High-Res, Low-Footprint:** Proprietary delta-codec packing shrinks each 48 kHz master to sub-50 kB without audible loss, perfect for on-chain permanence.
* **Pure Bitcoin Provenance:** Inscribed via Ordinals, the audio and vector scope data live immutably in the same ledger that secures BTC itself—no external servers, no broken links.
* **Interactive Playback:** Holders can stream the audio while watching the oscilloscope redraw in real time, or export the coordinate data to laser projectors and modular rigs.

#### Etymology meets artistry

Just as a **gnarl** is a rugged knot in seasoned wood, an Audio Gnarl is a twisted node in sonic space—proof that sound, like timber, carries its own grain and imperfections. Here, roughness becomes beauty, preserved forever in the most resilient archive humanity has: the Bitcoin chain.

Collect an Audio Gnarl and own a living knot of light and sound—small in bytes, vast in character, impossible to duplicate.
