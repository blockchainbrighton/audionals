# Seed Synth Package - Todo List

## Phase 1: Analyze existing code structure and dependencies ✓
- [x] Extract and examine uploaded ZIP file
- [x] Read requirements specification from pasted_content.txt
- [x] Analyze current code structure (osc-app.js, osc-controls.js, scope-canvas.js, seq-app.js, tone-loader.js)
- [x] Understand component interactions and dependencies
- [x] Copy source files to working directory

## Phase 2: Set up project structure and build system ✓
- [x] Create proper project directory structure (src/, dist/, examples/, etc.)
- [x] Initialize package.json with dependencies
- [x] Set up build system (esbuild for bundling)
- [x] Configure build scripts for ESM output

## Phase 3: Create unified seed-synth component with shadow DOM ✓
- [x] Create main SeedSynthElement class with shadow DOM
- [x] Inline and bundle all sub-components (osc-controls, scope-canvas, seq-app, tone-loader)
- [x] Preserve existing functionality and visual appearance
- [x] Maintain deterministic preset system

## Phase 4: Implement public API and event system ✓
- [x] Implement SeedSynthOptions interface
- [x] Add public methods (start, stop, mute, setCurrent, etc.)
- [x] Add attribute/property handling (seed, show-sequencer)
- [x] Implement event dispatching (ready, optionchange, statechange)
- [x] Add state save/restore functionality

## Phase 5: Bundle components and create distribution build ✓
- [x] Configure bundler to create single ESM file
- [x] Ensure no external dependencies beyond Tone.js
- [x] Test bundled component functionality
- [x] Optimize bundle size

## Phase 6: Create React wrapper component ✓
- [x] Create TypeScript React wrapper
- [x] Expose same API as custom element
- [x] Handle React-specific concerns (refs, events)

## Phase 7: Build examples and test functionality ✓
- [x] Create vanilla HTML example
- [x] Create React example with Vite
- [x] Test all functionality works as expected
- [x] Verify deterministic behavior with seeds

## Phase 8: Create documentation and deliver final package ✓
- [x] Write comprehensive README.md
- [x] Document API, installation, usage
- [x] Package final deliverables
- [x] Test examples work correctly
