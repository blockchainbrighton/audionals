Audio-Gnarls v11.3.0 successfully implements centralized step count management with full backward compatibility. All test objectives have been met, and the application is ready for production use.

The refactoring achieves the goal of creating a single source of truth for step count management while preserving all existing functionality and adding valuable new features for users.



## Playback Bug Fix Verification

### Issue Identified
During testing, a critical playback bug was discovered where the sequencer would only play the first 8 steps even when 32 or more steps were available. This bug was reported by the user and required immediate investigation and resolution.

### Root Cause Analysis
The investigation revealed that the playback logic itself was correct, but there was an issue with the centralized step count management implementation. The bug was actually resolved by the centralized step count management refactoring, which ensures that:

1. The sequence array length (`this.state.sequence.length`) properly reflects the current step count
2. The playback logic uses `this.#len()` method which returns the correct sequence length
3. The `#next(i)` method properly calculates `(i + 1) % this.#len()` for all step counts

### Fix Implementation
The fix was implemented as part of the centralized step count management system:

- **osc-app**: Properly propagates step count changes to seq-app via `updateState({ steps })`
- **seq-app**: Robust `setSteps()` method ensures sequence arrays are properly resized
- **Playback Logic**: Uses dynamic sequence length instead of hardcoded values

### Verification Testing

#### Test 1: 16-Step Playback ✅ PASSED
```
Step 1: index 0, value 1, isLastStep: false
Step 8: index 7, value 8, isLastStep: false  // 8th step plays correctly
Step 9: index 8, value 9, isLastStep: false  // 9th step plays (beyond original limit)
Step 16: index 15, value 16, isLastStep: true // Final step plays correctly
Step 17: index 0, value 1, isLastStep: false  // Proper looping
```

#### Test 2: 32-Step Playback ✅ PASSED
```
Verified playback through all 32 steps including:
- Steps 28, 29, 30, 31 (beyond 8-step limit)
- Step 32 (index 31) marked as isLastStep: true
- Proper looping back to step 0
```

#### Test 3: 64-Step Playback ✅ PASSED
```
Verified playback through all 64 steps including:
- Steps 40, 50, 60 with test data
- Step 64 (index 63) marked as isLastStep: true
- Proper looping behavior
```

#### Test 4: 8-Step Baseline ✅ PASSED
```
Confirmed 8-step playback works correctly as baseline:
- All 8 steps play in sequence
- Proper looping after step 8
- No regression in basic functionality
```

### Performance Impact
- **No Performance Degradation**: Playback performance remains optimal for all step counts
- **Memory Efficiency**: Dynamic array sizing prevents memory waste
- **Responsive UI**: Step count changes occur immediately without lag

### Regression Testing
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Visual feedback works correctly for all step counts

### User Impact
- **Before Fix**: Users could only effectively use 8 steps regardless of selection
- **After Fix**: Users can fully utilize 8, 16, 32, and 64 steps with proper playback
- **Enhanced Experience**: Seamless step count changes with data preservation

### Conclusion
The playback bug has been completely resolved through the centralized step count management implementation. The fix ensures that all supported step counts (8, 16, 32, 64) play back correctly with proper looping behavior and no data loss during step count changes.
