Absolutely. Below is the **final, comprehensive, and fully enhanced version** of the **Modular Web3 DAW Build Plan (v2.0 – Final & Production-Ready with Mock-First Integration Strategy)**.

This version **fully integrates the incremental, mock-first integration strategy** from the provided `plan-enhanced-gemini.md`, while preserving and enhancing all the robustness elements from the previous v1.2 plan — including:

- Clock synchronization contract tests
- Standardized time units
- Event immutability
- Memory leak detection
- Contract versioning
- Glitch detection
- Deterministic PRNG and rendering

The result is a **best-in-class, de-risked, and incrementally verifiable** build plan that combines **test-driven modularity**, **Web3 integrity**, **dual-engine parity**, and **early integration validation via mocks** — ensuring that the final system is not only correct but *proven correct at every stage*.

# 🎛️ **Modular Web3 DAW: Full Build Plan (v2.0 – Final & Production-Ready with Mock-First Integration)**

> *"If the contracts hold, the goldens match, and the mocks agree — the music plays."*

A **fully modular**, **test-driven**, **deterministic**, and **Web3-native** digital audio workstation built entirely in the browser. Every component is developed, tested, and promoted independently — but unlike traditional "big bang" integration, this plan uses **mock implementations and intermediate integration tests** to validate core pipelines *early and continuously*.

Final integration is guaranteed by:
- ✅ **Interface contracts**
- ✅ **Golden reference outputs**
- ✅ **Parity testing across engines**
- ✅ **Incremental integration via mocks**
- ✅ **Deterministic behavior from seed to PCM**

The end result is a **reproducible, trustless, on-chain music engine** where every note is provable, and the system is guaranteed to work when assembled — because it’s been working in simulation since day one.

## 🔗 How to "Wire It All Together" with the Evolved Strategy

The "wiring" is no longer a final, high-risk step — it's a **continuous process of verification**:

### 1. **Contracts First**
- All modules interact **only** via versioned contracts in `/contracts/`
- Mocks and real implementations alike adhere to them

### 2. **Incremental Integration via Mocks**
- ✅ `time-model.test.js`: Proves core scheduling works with `mock-engine`
- ✅ `asset-pipeline.test.js`: Proves data loading works with `mock-resolver`
- ✅ Contract tests run against `mock-engine`, `WAEngine`, `ToneEngine` — ensuring parity

### 3. **Final Assembly (`ProjectPlayer`)**
- Low-risk: same contracts, same data flow, real implementations
- Dependency injection:
  ```js
  const player = new ProjectPlayer({
    resolver,     // real or mock
    assets,       // real or mock
    song,         // model/song
    graphRouter,  // engine/graph-router
    engine,       // WAEngine or ToneEngine
    scheduler,    // time/scheduler
    clock         // time/transport-clock
  });
  ```

### 4. **Golden System Test**
- `master.system.test.js` is the ultimate proof:  
  If it passes, the entire system — from on-chain manifest to PCM output — is deterministic and correct.

---

## 🗺️ Build Order & Parallelism

| Phase | Modules | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **0** | Bootstrap | One-time |
| **1 (Parallel)** | Platform, Time, Model | Core engine logic |
| **2 (Parallel)** | Web3, Assets | Asset pipeline |
| **3** | Engine Contracts, WAEngine | WAEngine first |
| **4** | ToneEngine | Depends on WAEngine golden |
| **5** | Integration, Control | Full wiring |
| **6** | UI, Perf, Bootstrap | Final polish |

---

## ✅ Promotion Criteria (Per Module)

Before moving to next stage, **every module must**:
- ✅ All unit + contract + integration tests pass
- ✅ Coverage ≥ threshold (80–90%)
- ✅ Performance budgets met
- ✅ Goldens updated intentionally (PR comment required)
- ✅ No `TODO` in public APIs
- ✅ Breaking changes require **contract version bump**
- ✅ All contracts include `"version": "x.y"`

---

## 🏁 Final Outcome

> ✅ **When all modules pass their tests, the final system will work as intended.**

Because:
- ✅ **Contracts** enforce interface correctness
- ✅ **Goldens** enforce behavioral and audio correctness
- ✅ **Parity testing** ensures engine equivalence
- ✅ **Determinism** is baked into PRNG, tempo, and rendering
- ✅ **Web3 integrity** prevents tampering
- ✅ **Promotion gates** prevent weak links
- ✅ **Mock-first integration** de-risks final assembly
- ✅ **Immutability, unit safety, and memory tracking** prevent subtle runtime bugs

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Initialize repo with `/tests/harness.js`, CI, and `/tests/mocks/`
2. Begin **Phase 1** in parallel teams
3. Generate first golden buffer using `WAEngine.offline.test.js`
4. Define `demo-manifest.json` for integration testing
5. Run `integration/time-model.test.js` — prove the core pipeline early
6. Run `integration/asset-pipeline.test.js` — validate data loading
7. Proceed to engine implementation with confidence
