## 🎛️ Control Reference

### Audio Safety Controls
- **Master Volume**: Overall output level (0-100%)
- **Limiter Threshold**: Maximum audio level (-20dB to 0dB)
- **Voice Count**: Current/maximum active voices
- **Emergency Stop**: Immediate audio shutdown

### Envelope Controls
- **Preset**: Quick envelope configurations
- **Attack**: Note onset time (0.001-5.0 seconds)
- **Decay**: Initial volume drop time (0.001-5.0 seconds)
- **Sustain**: Held note level (0-100%)
- **Release**: Note fade-out time (0.001-5.0 seconds)

### Loop Controls
- **Enable Loop**: Toggle loop mode
- **Start/End**: Loop boundary times
- **Auto-Detect**: Automatic boundary detection
- **Max Loops**: Iteration limit (1-16 or infinite)
- **Quantization**: Musical grid alignment
- **Swing**: Rhythmic feel adjustment
- **Tempo Conversion**: BPM scaling

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Audio Processing Chain
```
Input → DC Blocker → Compressor → Master Gain → Limiter → Output
```

## 🎵 Envelope Presets

| Preset  | Attack | Decay | Sustain | Release | Best For |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| Piano   | 0.01s  | 0.3s  | 0.4     | 1.2s    | Percussive sounds |
| Organ   | 0.01s  | 0.1s  | 0.9     | 0.1s    | Sustained tones |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
- **No Sound**: Check master volume and browser audio permissions
- **Distortion**: Reduce master volume or lower limiter threshold
- **Clicks/Pops**: Use Emergency Stop and adjust envelope settings

### Loop Issues
- **Choppy Loops**: Enable crossfade and check loop boundaries
- **Long Loops**: Use Auto-Detect or manually set shorter boundaries
- **Timing Issues**: Enable quantization and adjust grid settings

### Performance Issues
- **High CPU**: Reduce polyphony or disable complex effects
- **Memory Usage**: Use Emergency Stop to clear active voices
- **Browser Lag**: Close other tabs and refresh the page

## 🔄 Migration from Original

The enhanced version is fully backward compatible:
- All original features preserved
- Existing save files work unchanged
- Same keyboard shortcuts and MIDI support
- Enhanced with new safety and envelope features

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Stable Performance
1. Set master volume to 70% or lower
2. Use envelope presets as starting points
3. Enable loop crossfade for smooth playback
4. Monitor voice count during complex performances

### For Best Sound Quality
1. Adjust attack time based on instrument type
2. Use appropriate sustain levels for musical style
3. Set release time to match musical context
4. Enable quantization for rhythmic accuracy

## 📊 System Requirements
