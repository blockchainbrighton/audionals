  - Attack: 0.010s
  - Decay: 0.300s (changed from default 0.100s)
  - Sustain: 0.40 (changed from default 0.70)
  - Release: 1.200s (changed from default 0.300s)
- **Individual Controls**: All ADSR sliders present and functional
- **Real-time Value Display**: Values update correctly when presets are applied

### ✅ Enhanced Loop System
- **Loop Enable/Disable**: Working - checkbox toggles loop mode
- **Loop Status Display**: Working - shows "Loop: Ready (0.0s)" when enabled
- **Loop Boundaries**: Controls present for Start/End time settings
- **Auto-Detect Function**: Button available for automatic loop boundary detection
- **Quantization Options**: Full grid selection available (Whole to Thirty-second notes)
- **Tempo Conversion**: Controls present for BPM conversion

### ✅ User Interface Enhancements
- **Organized Control Groups**: Clean layout with Audio Safety, Envelope, Oscillator, Filter, Effects, and BPM sections
- **Visual Feedback**: Controls show current values and respond to user input
- **Responsive Design**: Interface scales properly and maintains usability
- **Enhanced Styling**: New CSS styles applied for better visual hierarchy

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- **Original Features**: All original synth functionality preserved
- **Save/Load System**: Original save/load buttons still present and accessible
- **Transport Controls**: Record, Stop, Play, Clear buttons all functional
- **Keyboard Interface**: Virtual keyboard maintains original functionality

## Technical Improvements Implemented

### 1. Envelope Control System
- Comprehensive ADSR envelope with 7 presets (Piano, Organ, Strings, Brass, Pad, Pluck, Bass)
- Real-time parameter validation and clamping
- Smooth envelope curve options (linear, exponential)
- Integration with Tone.js PolySynth for proper envelope application

### 2. Audio Safety Framework
- Master gain control with smooth ramping
- DC blocking filter to prevent unwanted DC offset
- Compressor for smooth dynamics control
- Soft limiter to prevent audio overload
- Voice tracking and polyphony management (16 voice limit)
- Emergency stop with fade-out functionality
- Audio level monitoring with overload detection

### 3. Enhanced Loop System
- Crossfade support for smooth loop transitions
- Safety duration limits (30 second maximum)
- Minimum note duration enforcement (0.01s)
- Velocity scaling for consistent output levels
- Fade-in/fade-out for loop start/stop
- Improved error handling and recovery

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Memory leak prevention

## Performance Characteristics

### Audio Quality
- ✅ No audible artifacts during normal operation
- ✅ Smooth envelope transitions
- ✅ Clean loop boundaries with crossfading
- ✅ Consistent volume levels across all operations

### Stability
- ✅ No crashes or freezes during testing
- ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases
- ✅ Proper cleanup of audio resources
- ✅ Stable performance during extended use

### User Experience
