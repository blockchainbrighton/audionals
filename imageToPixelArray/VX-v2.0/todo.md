## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETE âœ…

All phases successfully completed. The Enhanced Helmet Pixel Art Studio is ready for use with all requested features implemented and tested.

## Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Save/Export Sync**: Exports don't always reflect latest visible grid state
2. **Visor Support**: No dedicated visor layer or editing capabilities
3. **UI Layout**: Current layout doesn't highlight helmet/visor editing workflow
4. **Layer Management**: No proper layer system for helmet vs visor
5. **State Management**: Inconsistent state updates between UI and data
