# ✅ **1. MASS EMAIL (with full sustainability plan)**

**Subject:** Request for unused/retired gauze for testing – Brighton Festival project (sustainability initiative)

```text
Dear [Name],

I hope you’re well.

My name is Jim Crane, and I’m working as the freelance Production Manager on a project being developed, in-house, by Brighton Dome and Brighton Festival. We are preparing a large-format gauze-based concept and, before purchasing new cloth, we are hoping to test materials using gauze that has fallen out of service.

We are looking for any gauze (sharkstooth, bobbinet, filled cloth, or similar) in widths from approximately 12m up to 40m. Condition is not important — stained, torn, patched, painted or otherwise unsuitable for rental or stage use is absolutely fine. Seamed pieces are also welcome.

**This is part of a sustainability-driven pilot for the Festival**, and we are committed to ensuring that any borrowed or donated material does **not** end up in landfill. We have created a set of onward-use chains so all cloth is reused, repurposed, or recycled after testing:

**1) Redistribution to small theatres, youth groups & community companies**  
Cut-down sections will be offered to small local theatres, youth groups, university drama departments and fringe companies who regularly need gauze but cannot afford it.

**2) Donation to scenic studios for reuse**  
Scenic shops can reuse gauze for paint rooms, spray booths, CNC areas, masking, and protection of scenic pieces.

**3) Transformation into useful theatre items**  
Unsuitable fabric can be sewn into cable socks, sandbag outers, prop wrap bags, dropcloths and studio protection materials.

**4) Certified textile recycling**  
Any remaining unusable cloth will be sent to textile recycling partners with zero-landfill policies for fibre recovery (e.g., acoustic insulation, industrial felt, stuffing). 

**5) Community arts programmes**  
Brighton community art groups and Festival partners can reuse offcuts for banners, installations, lantern work and educational activities.

We can collect and manage all transport/logistics, and can keep you updated on where the material ultimately goes if you wish.

If you have any gauze heading out of service now or soon, or if you know of any organisations that might, I’d be extremely grateful to hear from you.

With many thanks and best wishes,

# ✅ **3. CONTACT LIST (same as before — now implied to support sustainability pitch)**

*(No change required in listings themselves; sustainability plan is in your outreach message.)*
If you'd like, I can expand this list to 100+ targeted UK theatre/scenic email contacts.

# ✅ **4. PITCH DECK (FULL VERSION WITH SUSTAINABILITY PLAN)**

Below is the complete text for a short slide deck you can paste into PowerPoint/Google Slides.

---

## **Slide 1 — Title**

**Large-Format Gauze Testing Project**
For Brighton Festival
**Zero-Landfill Sustainability Initiative**
Prepared by: **Jim Crane – Freelance Production Manager**
[jimdotbtc@gmail.com](mailto:jimdotbtc@gmail.com) | 07765 241717

## **Slide 2 — Overview**

* Brighton Festival project requiring extremely wide gauze (12–40m).
* Before purchasing new cloth, extensive testing is needed.
* Aim: test translucency, projection response, texture, structural qualities.
* Opportunity to adopt a circular, sustainable approach.

---

## **Slide 3 — The Ask**

We are requesting **retired or unusable gauze** from:

* Theatres
* Rental houses
* Scenic studios
* Opera/ballet companies
* Production stores

Condition does not matter — stained, painted, patched, torn, discoloured, or stretched cloth is perfect.

---

## **Slide 4 — Why Retired Gauze Works for Us**

* Low-risk material for testing
* Wide variety of colours & weaves
* Enables experimentation before procurement
* Reduces pressure on new manufacturing
* Avoids waste by using cloth destined for disposal

---

## **Slide 5 — Our Sustainability Commitment**

**This is a zero-landfill project.**
All gauze will enter one of several onward lifecycle chains after testing.

---

## **Slide 6 — Onward Chain 1: Redistribution (Reuse)**

High-value circulation to:

* Small theatres
* Am-dram groups
* Youth theatre companies
* Fringe artists
* University and drama school departments

Benefits:

* Extends the life of the cloth
* Supports low-budget creative work
* Encourages circular theatre-making

---

## **Slide 7 — Onward Chain 2: Scenic Workshop Reuse**

Scenic shops can use downgraded cloth for:

* Paint rooms
* Spray booths
* CNC dust masking
* Wrapping/protecting scenic elements
* Storage protection

Benefits: replaces virgin materials used as dust sheets/masking.

---

## **Slide 8 — Onward Chain 3: Transformation (Upcycling)**

Where cloth is damaged:

* Cable socks
* Sandbag outers
* Soft scenic bags
* Dropcloths
* Prop protection wraps
* Garage/workshop coverings

Benefits: extends life through crafting and repurposing.

---

## **Slide 9 — Onward Chain 4: Textile Recycling**

For cloth beyond reuse:

* Partner with textile recyclers with zero-landfill policies
* Fibre converted into:
  • acoustic insulation
  • industrial felt
  • mattress fill
  • stuffing
  • industrial cloths

---

## **Slide 10 — Onward Chain 5: Community & Arts Use**

Brighton and southeast arts communities can repurpose offcuts:

* Banners
* Outdoor installations
* Lantern structures
* Craft and education projects

Fits perfectly with the Festival’s civic engagement ethos.

---

## **Slide 11 — Logistics & Support**

* Collection coordinated by Jim Crane
* Storage & cataloguing
* Testing phase
* Post-testing onward-chain distribution
* Reporting available for donors

Optional:

* Donors listed/credited
* Impact summary shared

---

## **Slide 12 — Benefits for Donating Organisations**

* Free removal of obsolete stock
* Space cleared from storage
