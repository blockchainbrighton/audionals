# <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">1. Project Overview</span>

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">Purpose & Objectives</span>

The Brighton Festival is planning a large-scale production in the Corn Exchange requiring **very wide theatrical gauze (scrim)**. Since commercial scrims such as *GobelinTulle* or *Cyclo 270* reach widths only around **10–12 m**, wider surfaces must be built by seaming multiple panels.

To determine the correct material, the team needs **hundreds of metres of cloth for in-situ testing**. To avoid unnecessary purchasing, the project aims to **borrow or acquire retired/off-cut gauze** from other organisations, test densities and weave types, and purchase new stock only once the design is confirmed.

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">Sustainability Ambitions</span>

Sustainability is a core project value. Following guidance from the **Theatre Green Book**, which encourages reuse and material exchange, the project will:

* Source **decommissioned scrim** rather than buying new
* Divert material from landfill
* Reduce carbon emissions
* Build relationships with reuse hubs and suppliers

A **circular end-of-life plan** ensures all gauze — borrowed or purchased — remains out of landfill (see *Onward Chain Plan* below).

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">Outreach Strategy Summary</span>

**1. Engage reuse networks**
Set-Exchange, Re-Set Scenery, Scenery Salvage, Resource Hub and others can supply ex-rental or decommissioned scrim.

**2. Leverage community forums**
Production Managers Forum, Set-Exchange message boards and Facebook groups.

**3. Partner with suppliers**
ShowTex, J&C Joel, Flints, Stage Electrics — with interest in off-cuts and ex-rental stock. ShowTex lines (GobelinTulle, Cyclo 270) provide technical benchmarks.

**4. Map onward use**
Plan recycling, reuse and repurposing routes (detailed in the onward chain plan).

# <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">2. Research Sources</span>

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">Technical Data on Theatrical Scrim</span>

#### **GobelinTulle (ShowTex)**

* Cotton theatre scrim
* Widths: **4.5 m → 11.8 m**
* Lengths: up to **70 m** (varies by width)
* Confirms commercial scrims rarely exceed **12 m**.

#### **Cyclo 270 (ShowTex)**

* Heavyweight cyclorama cloth
* Widths: **6.4 m, 8 m, 10 m, 12 m**
* Lengths: up to **60 m**

These define realistic expectations for gauze width availability.

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">Theatre Green Book Guidance</span>

Encourages:

* material reuse
* exchange of scenic elements
* use of networks such as Set-Exchange, Re-Set Scenery, Resource Hub etc.

This research directly informs the outreach strategy.

**Body:**
*(Formatted cleanly for direct use — unchanged text but neatly laid out)*

> Dear colleagues,
>
> I hope you are well. I’m **Jim Crane, Production Manager for Brighton Festival**, and I’m reaching out with a request that supports both our artistic ambitions and our sustainability goals.
>
> We are preparing a new production requiring very wide theatrical gauze. Commercial scrim rarely exceeds 10–12 m. To achieve the 40 m surface we need, we plan to borrow or acquire retired gauze for testing before purchasing new fabric.
>
> Borrowing surplus gauze aligns with the Theatre Green Book principles of reuse and recycling. It reduces waste, lowers carbon emissions and ensures we choose the right material.
>
> **We will cover transport, return fabric if needed, and keep all materials in the reuse loop.**
>
> Please contact **[jim.crane@brightonfestival.org](mailto:jim.crane@brightonfestival.org)** or **+44 (0)1273 999 123** if you can assist.
