To source "hundreds of meters" of 12m–40m wide theatrical gauze for free or low cost, you must pivot from standard "shopping" to a **waste-stream interception strategy**. The specific dimensions you require (12m–40m widths) are exceptionally rare and typically only used by opera houses and major rental companies.

The following plan leverages your location (Brighton), the "Theatre Green Book" circular economy principles, and specific industry disposal protocols.

## Strategy 1: The "Local Intercept" (Glyndebourne)
Your proximity to **Glyndebourne** (approx. 10 miles from Brighton) is your strongest asset. Opera productions use the massive seamless cloths (40m+) you require, and Glyndebourne has aggressively committed to "zero waste to landfill" and circular economy targets.

*   **The Opportunity:** Glyndebourne has a dedicated "Production Hub" and sustainability champions in every department. They have committed to pre-agreeing disposal or reuse plans for every component of their productions.
*   **Action:** Contact their technical department immediately. Do not ask for "spare stock"; ask specifically if they have **"condemned"** or **"end-of-run"** scenic gauzes scheduled for disposal or recycling.
*   **Contact:** Research indicates **Kathryn Donkin** or **Rhodri Thomas** have been involved with their environmental initiatives. Alternatively, approach the Production Manager directly via their general switchboard, referencing their "Theatre Green Book" commitments.

## Strategy 2: Rental House "Graveyards" (Condemned Stock)
Major drape hire companies periodically "rag out" (condemn) stock that has stains, tears, or has lost its fire retardancy certification. This stock is often shredded or sold as rags.

*   **Target Companies:**
    *   **Blackout Ltd:** A major supplier of large-scale drapes and rigging. They are based in London but service large events; they will have high-volume turnover of 12m+ cloths.
    *   **Cover It Up / Acre Jean:** Specialists in soft goods who handle massive inventories.
*   **The Ask:** When contacting them, explicitly request **"condemned stock"** or **"rag-out grade"** gauze. Clarify that aesthetics (stains/tears) do not matter as it is for *lighting tests* only.
*   **Logistics:** Be prepared to collect immediately. Rental houses prioritize space; if you can solve their disposal logistics, they are more likely to give you the material.

## Strategy 3: The "Hack" Substitute (FR Debris Netting)
If you cannot find genuine theatrical gauze, **Flame Retardant (FR) Debris Netting** is the industry-standard low-cost substitute for lighting tests.

*   **Why it works:** It has a similar open-weave structure to Sharkstooth Gauze, allowing for bleed-through lighting effects (making objects appear/disappear).
*   **Cost/Availability:** Unlike theatrical gauze (£30+/meter), debris netting is industrial/construction grade and extremely cheap.
*   **Certification:** Crucially, you can buy **BS 5867 certified** (UK standard) debris netting. This solves the fire officer problem at the Corn Exchange.
*   **Suppliers:**
    *   **Leachs:** Stocks "BIGBEN Superclad" FR debris netting (2m–3m widths).
    *   **Knowle Nets:** Stocks white FR debris netting certified to BS 5867 Part 2 Type B.
    *   *Note:* You will likely need to seam these (cable tie or sew) to reach 12m widths, but for testing purposes, this is often acceptable.

## Strategy 4: The "Circular Economy" Hubs
The **National Theatre** recently launched the **Green Store** in Bermondsey to facilitate the reuse of costumes and scenery. While primarily internal, they are a flagship for the Theatre Green Book and may allow access to "dead" stock for a fellow PMF member, especially for non-commercial testing.

Additionally, monitor **Set Exchange** and **Scenery Salvage**, where venues list items for free to avoid skip costs.

## Critical Safety Warning: The "Fire Officer" Trap
The Brighton Corn Exchange is a licensed public venue. The biggest risk with "borrowed" or "fallen out of service" gauze is **Flame Retardancy (FR)**.

1.  **NDFR Status:** Most theatrical gauze is "Non-Durably Flame Retardant" (NDFR). If it has "fallen out of service," it is likely because the FR chemicals have expired or the cloth has been damp.
2.  **The Risk:** The Corn Exchange technical team may legally refuse to hang uncertified cloth, even for testing.
3.  **Mitigation:**
    *   **Option A:** Buy the BS 5867 certified Debris Netting (Strategy 3) – it comes with a certificate.
    *   **Option B:** If you borrow old gauze, budget for **Flamebar** or a similar DIY flame-proofing solution and perform a burn test (check with the venue's Technical Manager *before* arrival).

## Executing the PMF "Ask"
Since you are already on the Production Managers Forum, use this specific template to signal you are a serious operator, not just a scavenger:

> **Subject:** WANTED: Condemned/Rag-Out Scenic Gauze for Lighting Tests (Any Condition)
>
> "I am looking to intercept large-format Sharkstooth or Bobbinet gauze (12m+ widths) currently destined for the skip/rag-out.
>
> **Purpose:** Lighting/bleed-through stress testing only. Aesthetic condition (stains, tears, paint) is irrelevant.
> **Logistics:** Can collect immediately from London/South East (or courier).
> **Sustainability:** We are working to Theatre Green Book principles to avoid buying virgin material for testing.
>
> Happy to take stock that has failed FR testing (we will treat/risk-assess for our closed session)."
