# <span style="color:#2F4F4F;">♻️ Project Green-Gauze: Strategic Sourcing & Disposal</span>

**Location:** <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Brighton Corn Exchange</span>
**Scope:** <span style="color:#4682B4;">Extreme-Width Testing (12m–40m)</span>
**Mandate:** <span style="color:#228B22;">Zero-Landfill</span>

---

## <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">🗺️ Phase 1: Sourcing Strategy (The "Beg, Borrow, & Proxy")</span>

<span style="color:#708090;">*Securing 12m+ widths of custom-sewn Sharkstooth Gauze is expensive and rare. We will leverage "dead stock" to solve two problems at once: our need for material and the supplier's need for space.*</span>

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">1. Target the "Rental Graveyards" 🏢</span>

Large rental houses pay high storage fees for **"condemned" stock**—items too damaged to rent but perfect for **destructive testing**.

* **The Leverage:** You are offering a <span style="color:#228B22;">free waste disposal service</span> for bulky items they are currently paying to store.
* **Primary Targets:** **Acre Jean** (huge stock), **Cover It Up** (Camberwell based), **Blackout**.

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">2. The "Local Giant" Loophole 🎭</span>

**Glyndebourne Festival Opera** is neighbours with Brighton and aggressively pursues <span style="color:#228B22;">Theatre Green Book</span> standards.

* <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Strategy:</span> They often build bespoke storage for old scenery. They are highly motivated by <span style="color:#228B22;">sustainability metrics</span> and may have **retired soft goods**.

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">3. The "Proxy" Solution: Scaffold Debris Netting 🏗️</span>

If theatrical gauze is unavailable, **Fire Retardant (FR) Scaffold Debris Netting** is a viable **optical proxy**.

* **Source:** **ACE Scaffolding**, **Amphibian Scaffolding**.
* <span style="color:#B22222; font-weight:bold;">CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:</span> Material **must** be **TS62 Certified** to be legal for use inside the Corn Exchange.

---

## <span style="color:#2E8B57;">♻️ Phase 2: The "Onward Chain" (Zero-Landfill Protocol)</span>

<span style="color:#708090;">*To meet the mandate, disposal streams must be segregated by material type immediately after testing.*</span>

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">🧶 Chain A: Cotton Gauze (The "Shoddy" Route)</span>

<span style="color:#708090;">*Most theatrical gauze is cotton treated with NDFR.*</span>

1. **Reuse (Arts):** <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Gladrags (Brighton)</span> or <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">The Scrap Space</span>.
   Best for cleaner sections of fabric suitable for costumes/small sets.

2. **Industrial Recycling:** <span style="color:#2E8B57;">LMB Supplies</span>.
   If too damaged/dirty, it is sent here to be shredded for insulation (known as **"shoddy"**) or automotive felt.

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">🥤 Chain B: Synthetic/Netting (The "HDPE" Route)</span>

<span style="color:#708090;">*Scaffold netting is HDPE plastic and cannot be composted or pulped.*</span>

1. **Rigid Recycling:** <span style="color:#2E8B57;">S&P Group (Blue Cycle Scheme)</span> or <span style="color:#2E8B57;">Magpie Recycling</span>.
   This must be processed as **rigid plastic recycling**, not general textile waste.

## <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">📢 Communication Toolkit</span>

<span style="color:#708090;">*Copy, paste, and customize these templates to secure materials and disposal routes.*</span>

---

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">📨 Sourcing Templates (Getting the Material)</span>

#### <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Option A: To Theatrical Rental Houses</span>

Based on your specific context—that this is for a **Festival show** attempting a unique **full-depth activation** of the Corn Exchange—I have refined the documentation.

The key updates below focus on **reframing the "Ask."** When approaching suppliers, mentioning that this is for a "Festival Production" rather than just a "sustainability test" adds prestige and urgency. It also explains *why* you need such extreme dimensions (activating the whole hall, not just the stage).

Here is the revised project strategy and communication toolkit.

**Context:** <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Festival Production R&D</span>
**Location:** <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Brighton Corn Exchange</span>
**Scope:** <span style="color:#4682B4;">Full-Depth Venue Activation (Extreme Widths 12m–40m)</span>
**Mandate:** <span style="color:#228B22;">Zero-Landfill</span>

---

## <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">🗺️ Phase 1: Sourcing Strategy (The "Beg, Borrow, & Proxy")</span>

<span style="color:#708090;">*To activate the full depth of the Corn Exchange (beyond the standard stage), we need exceptional material widths (up to 40m). Buying new custom-sewn gauze for destructive testing is financially and environmentally irresponsible. We will leverage "dead stock" to solve our material need and the supplier's storage problem.*</span>

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">1. Target the "Rental Graveyards" 🏢</span>

Large rental houses pay high storage fees for **"condemned" stock**—items too damaged to rent but perfect for **destructive testing** and large-scale lighting trials.

*   **The Leverage:** You are offering a <span style="color:#228B22;">free waste disposal service</span> for bulky items they are currently paying to store, while giving them a "Sustainability Partner" credit for a Festival show.
*   **Primary Targets:** **Acre Jean** (huge stock), **Cover It Up** (Camberwell based), **Blackout**.

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">2. The "Local Giant" Loophole 🎭</span>

**Glyndebourne Festival Opera** is neighbours with Brighton and aggressively pursues <span style="color:#228B22;">Theatre Green Book</span> standards.

*   <span style="color:#6A5ACD;">Strategy:</span> Leverage the "Festival" connection. They may have retired soft goods that are too large for standard theatre use but perfect for your full-depth Corn Exchange tests.

### <span style="color:#4682B4;">3. The "Proxy" Solution: Scaffold Debris Netting 🏗️</span>

If theatrical gauze is unavailable, **Fire Retardant (FR) Scaffold Debris Netting** is a viable **optical proxy** for lighting depth tests.

*   **Source:** **ACE Scaffolding**, **Amphibian Scaffolding**.
*   <span style="color:#B22222; font-weight:bold;">CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:</span> Material **must** be **TS62 Certified** to be legal for use inside the Corn Exchange.

>
> Dear [Stock Manager Name],
>
> I am contacting you regarding the R&D phase for an upcoming **Festival production** at the **Brighton Corn Exchange**.
>
> We are attempting a unique **full-depth activation** of the venue (utilizing the entire 40m depth of the hall rather than just the stage). To test this scale, we require extreme-width (12m–40m) Sharkstooth or Bobbinet gauze.
>
> We are specifically looking for **"dead stock"**—items condemned due to tears/stains that are no longer suitable for your rental inventory, but perfect for our destructive lighting tests.
>
> **Our Offer:**
> We can arrange collection of these bulky items at <span style="color:#228B22; font-weight:bold;">zero cost to you</span>, saving your team disposal fees and warehouse space. We guarantee a **Zero Landfill** protocol:
>
> *   The material is used for technical testing only.
> *   Post-test, it is processed via verified textile recyclers (for insulation/shoddy).
>
> Do you have any condemned large-scale gauzes we could collect/divert next week?
>
> Best regards,

We are testing a "full-depth" concept and looking for condemned/unrentable wide-width gauze (12m+) for destructive testing. If you have any dead stock taking up space, we can collect it for free and handle the recycling (<span style="color:#228B22;">zero landfill</span>).

>
> Hi [Office Team],
>
> We are running a technical lighting test for a Festival show at the Brighton Corn Exchange and are looking for used **White Debris Netting**.
>
> To meet our sustainability goals, we want to avoid buying new plastic. We are happy to take dirty or used rolls that have finished their life on a construction site, provided they are **TS62 Fire Retardant certified**.
>
> Do you have any stripped netting coming back to your yard this week that we could collect/divert from the skip? We will ensure it is recycled via the <span style="color:#2E8B57;">Blue Cycle</span> scheme after our tests.
>
> Thanks,
