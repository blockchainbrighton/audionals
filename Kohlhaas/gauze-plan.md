## Phase 1: Sourcing Strategy (The "Beg, Borrow, & Proxy")

Securing 12m+ widths of Sharkstooth Gauze is challenging because these dimensions are typically custom-sewn. Your best leverage is that large rental houses pay significant storage fees for "condemned" stock that is too damaged to rent but perfect for testing.

### 1. Target the "Rental Graveyards"
The largest UK rental houses hold massive inventories of blacks and gauzes. When a 12m x 20m gauze gets a tear, it often becomes unrentable "dead stock." You can offer to save them disposal costs by collecting it.
*   **Primary Targets**:
    *   **Acre Jean**: They hold extensive stocks of Sharkstooth Gauze and Filled Cloth cycloramas in massive dimensions.
    *   **Cover It Up**: Known for "huge stock" and "bespoke backdrops," they frequently manage large-scale theatre drapery and may have retired items in their Camberwell warehouse.
    *   **Blackout**: A major player with significant stock that likely includes retired wide-width items.
*   **The Pitch**: "We are conducting a sustainability study at the Brighton Corn Exchange and can offer a zero-cost disposal route for any condemned wide-width Sharkstooth or Bobbinet gauze in your warehouse. We will handle the transport and ensure it is recycled, not landfilled."

### 2. The "Local Giant" Loophole
**Glyndebourne Festival Opera** is located just outside Brighton and is aggressively pursuing Theatre Green Book standards.
*   **Strategy**: They are committed to "recycling materials from our stores as much as we can" and have previously created bespoke storage from old scenery.
*   **Action**: Contact their technical or production management department specifically regarding "retired soft goods" or "scenery salvage." They are likely to have large-scale items suitable for your widths.

### 3. The "Manufacturer's Seconds" Channel
Manufacturers often have "mill ends" or "seconds" (fabric with weaving flaws) that cannot be sold at full price.
*   **Targets**:
    *   **J&C Joel**: A leading manufacturer of theatrical fabric. They have a "Clearance" section and may have damaged mill rolls of gauze.
    *   **Whaleys Stages**: Based in Bradford, they supply NDFR cottons and may have offcuts or flawed batches.

### 4. The "Proxy" Solution: Scaffold Debris Netting
If theatrical gauze is unavailable, **Fire Retardant (FR) Scaffold Debris Netting** is a viable optical proxy for lighting tests.
*   **Why it works**: It is an open-weave mesh that mimics the "bleed-through" effect of gauze.
*   **Availability**: It is cheap, abundant on construction sites, and often discarded after a single project.
*   **Safety Critical**: You **must** ensure any netting used is **TS62 Certified** (the fire safety standard for construction netting) to be legal for use inside the Corn Exchange.
*   **Source**: Contact local Brighton scaffolding firms like **ACE Scaffolding** or **Amphibian Scaffolding**, both of whom advertise environmental responsibility. Ask for used white TS62 netting.

## Phase 2: The "Onward Chain" (Zero Landfill Protocol)

To meet the "zero landfill" requirement, you must segregate your disposal streams based on the material type (Cotton vs. Synthetic/Proxy).

### Chain A: Cotton Gauze (The "Shoddy" Route)
Most theatrical gauze is cotton treated with NDFR (Non-Durable Flame Retardant).
1.  **Reuse (Arts)**: Contact **Gladrags** in Brighton or **The Scrap Space** (Adur). They accept textiles for community reuse.
    *   *Constraint*: They may not accept dirty or heavily damaged scenery.
2.  **Industrial Recycling (Insulation)**: If the gauze is too damaged for arts reuse, send it to a "shoddy" manufacturer. These companies shred cotton textiles to create thermal/acoustic insulation and automotive felt.
    *   *Partner*: **LMB Supplies** or **Biotech** (recyclers who process industrial rags and shredding).
3.  **Agricultural Use (Frost Protection)**: Cotton gauze can be used as frost protection for crops. **Critical Warning**: You must verify the flame retardant chemical.
    *   *Safe*: Ammonium Polyphosphate (common in NDFR). It acts as a fertilizer in soil.
    *   *Unsafe*: Boron-based retardants. These can be toxic to plants. Check the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of the specific gauze before donating to farms.

### Chain B: Synthetic/Scaffold Netting (The "HDPE" Route)
If you use scaffold netting (HDPE plastic), it cannot be composted or pulped.
1.  **Recycling**: HDPE is recyclable. Companies like **S&P Group** run a "Blue Cycle Recycling Scheme" specifically for returning scaffold netting.
2.  **Local Processing**: Brighton & Hove Council partners with **A-Tex** for textile banks, but for rigid/industrial plastics, you may need a specialized commercial waste contractor like **Magpie Recycling** or **Rabbit Group** in Brighton.

## Summary of Operations

| Step | Material | Action | Partner/Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | Theatrical Gauze | Request "condemned" or "dead" stock | **Cover It Up**, **Acre Jean**, **Blackout**, **Glyndebourne** |
| **Source** | Proxy (Netting) | Request used TS62 white netting | **ACE Scaffolding**, **Amphibian Scaffolding** |
| **Disposal 1** | Clean Cotton | Donate for arts/community reuse | **Gladrags** (Brighton), **The Scrap Space** |
| **Disposal 2** | Dirty Cotton | Shred for Insulation ("Shoddy") | **LMB Supplies**, **Industrial Wiper Co.** |
| **Disposal 3** | HDPE Netting | Plastic Recycling Scheme | **S&P Group Blue Cycle**, **Magpie Recycling** |

This plan allows you to pitch the project to suppliers not just as a "favour," but as a **free waste disposal service** for them, solving their storage problems while meeting your testing needs.
