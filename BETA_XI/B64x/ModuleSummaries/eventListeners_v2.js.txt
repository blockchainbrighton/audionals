Filename: eventListeners_v2.js

Overview:
This file registers and manages a variety of event listeners to control the user interface and interaction logic of the sequencer application. It covers functionalities such as resuming audio playback, saving/loading settings, navigating between sequences, handling file input events for presets (including support for Gzip files), and managing modal interactions. The file ensures that user actions trigger the correct updates to both the UI and the underlying application state.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	DOM Elements:
	•	appContainer (identified as ‘drum-machine’): Used to resume audio playback upon click.
	•	Buttons for saving, loading, and navigating sequences (e.g., saveButton, loadButton, prev-sequence, next-sequence).
	•	File input (loadFileInput) for uploading JSON or Gzip settings files.
	•	Preset buttons (loadInternalPreset1 to loadInternalPreset6) and a dynamically created cancel button (cancelButton) for load options.
	•	Helper Functions:
	•	setupSequenceNav(buttonId, offset): Sets up navigation between sequences based on a given offset.
	•	loadSettingsAndFetchAudio(jsonSettings): Loads settings from a file, updates the sequencer state, and fetches associated audio samples.
	•	loadPresetFromFile(filePath): Fetches a preset file and loads its settings into the application.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	DOM Event Handling: Uses DOMContentLoaded to ensure all elements are loaded before attaching event listeners.
	•	Event Delegation and Listener Binding: Listeners are bound directly to specific UI elements, with functions encapsulated to handle their respective events (e.g., clicks, input changes).
	•	Asynchronous File Processing: Uses the FileReader API and conditional handling (based on file extension) to read and process both JSON and Gzip files asynchronously.
	•	Inter-Window Communication: Contains logic to send messages (via postMessage) to a slave window for sequence transitions, indicating a multi-window synchronization mechanism.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Dynamic UI Element Creation: Checks for the existence of a cancel button and creates one if absent, ensuring robust UI behavior.
	•	Preset Loading Workflow: Integrates fetching of external JSON preset files, processing them, and updating the sequencer state with proper error handling.
	•	Audio Context Resumption: Registers a click listener on the main app container to resume the AudioContext, addressing common browser autoplay restrictions.
	•	Modal Interaction: Implements multiple listeners for modal behavior, including closing the modal when clicking outside its content area, which improves the overall user experience.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Event Listener Consolidation: Some event listener setups (especially for similar UI components) could be refactored into a loop or a generic handler to reduce repetition.
	•	DOM Caching: Caching frequently accessed DOM elements can reduce the overhead of repeated DOM queries, especially in performance-critical sections like file processing and sequence navigation.
	•	Error Handling and User Feedback: Incorporating more robust UI-level error messaging (beyond console logs and alerts) could improve the application’s resilience and user experience.
	•	Code Modularity: Separating distinct functionalities (e.g., file loading, sequence navigation, modal handling) into their own modules or classes may enhance maintainability and testability.
