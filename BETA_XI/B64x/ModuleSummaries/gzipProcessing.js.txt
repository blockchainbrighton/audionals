Filename: gzipProcessing.js

Overview:
This file is responsible for handling Gzip compression and decompression of JSON data within the project. It dynamically loads the Pako library (a popular JavaScript compression library) if it is not already present, and then uses it to compress serialized JSON data into Gzip format or decompress Gzip data back into a string.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	loadPako: An asynchronous function that dynamically fetches and loads the Pako library from a CDN if it isn’t already defined.
	•	createGzipFile: An asynchronous function that compresses provided JSON data into Gzip format using Pako, then returns a Blob containing the compressed data.
	•	decompressGzipFile: An asynchronous function that decompresses Gzip data back into a JSON string using Pako.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Dynamic Library Loading: The file uses an asynchronous fetch mechanism to load an external library (Pako) on demand, ensuring the library is available before proceeding with compression or decompression.
	•	Asynchronous Programming: Utilizes async/await for handling asynchronous operations, ensuring sequential loading and processing of the library and data.
	•	Global Scope Exposure: After defining the functions, they are attached to the window object to make them globally accessible across the application.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Dynamic Dependency Management: The approach of checking if pako is defined and, if not, dynamically loading it ensures that the compression/decompression functionality is only initialized when necessary.
	•	Error Handling: The functions throw errors when expected input is missing (e.g., no JSON data provided for compression), and they log errors to the console if issues occur during fetch or processing.
	•	Blob Creation: The createGzipFile function wraps the compressed data into a Blob with the MIME type application/gzip, making it suitable for file download or further processing.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Caching Mechanism: Consider caching the loaded Pako library (or checking its load status) to avoid repeated dynamic loads if multiple compression/decompression calls occur in a short timeframe.
	•	Module Exports: If the project uses ES6 modules, exporting the functions rather than attaching them to the window object could improve modularity and testability.
	•	Enhanced Error Handling: Adding more descriptive error messages or fallback mechanisms could make the functions more robust in a production environment.
