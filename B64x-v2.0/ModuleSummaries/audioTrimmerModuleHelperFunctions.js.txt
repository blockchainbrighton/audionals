Filename: audioTrimmerModuleHelperFunctions.js

Overview:
This file provides helper functions that facilitate the integration of the AudioTrimmer class with the broader application. It manages the global instance of an audio trimmer, updates it with new audio buffers, and handles playback control through UI interactions. Additionally, it loads the audio trimmer module’s HTML content into a modal and binds event listeners for modal control and channel-specific audio trimming.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	currentTrimmerInstance: A global variable holding the active instance of the AudioTrimmer class.
	•	currentTrimmerChannelIndex: Tracks the channel index associated with the current trimmer instance.
	•	Helper Functions:
	•	updateAudioTrimmerWithBufferHelper(url, channelIndex): Retrieves an audio buffer from a cache and updates the trimmer.
	•	updateAudioTrimmerWithBuffer(audioBuffer): Updates the current trimmer instance with the provided audio buffer and refreshes its UI.
	•	playTrimmedAudioForChannel(channelIndex) & stopAudioForChannel(channelIndex): Control playback for the specified channel via the trimmer instance.
	•	initializeAudioTrimmer(channelIndex): Loads the audio trimmer module HTML, initializes a new AudioTrimmer instance, applies channel-specific trim settings, and displays the modal.
	•	applyTrimSettings(channelIndex): Applies trim settings from global settings to the active trimmer instance.
	•	getChannelUrl(channelIndex): Retrieves the channel URL from global settings for audio loading.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Fetch API: Uses the fetch method to load the audio trimmer module’s HTML content dynamically.
	•	Global State Integration: Interacts with window.unifiedSequencerSettings to retrieve channel URLs and trim settings, ensuring synchronization with the central sequencer state.
	•	Event Binding: Sets up event listeners on DOM elements (e.g., .open-audio-trimmer buttons and the modal’s close button) to trigger initialization, update, and control functions for the audio trimmer.
	•	Modular UI Management: Embeds the audio trimmer module into the DOM, displays it as a modal, and ensures that closing the modal captures and stores the current trim settings.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Global Instance Management: The file maintains a single global instance (currentTrimmerInstance) and corresponding channel index to prevent conflicts between channels.
	•	Dynamic Module Loading: Loads external HTML for the audio trimmer module, enabling modularity and potential reuse of the trimmer interface across different parts of the application.
	•	Integration with Global Settings: Functions such as applyTrimSettings and getChannelUrl tightly couple the trimmer functionality with the global sequencer settings, ensuring consistency of trim data across the app.
	•	Event Listener Setup: Uses DOMContentLoaded to ensure that event listeners for opening the audio trimmer modal are registered only after the DOM is fully loaded.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Error Recovery: Enhance error handling for scenarios when fetching the HTML module fails, possibly providing user feedback or a fallback interface.
	•	Decoupling Global State: Consider decoupling the helper functions from direct global variable access to improve modularity and facilitate unit testing.
	•	Consistent Naming Conventions: Standardize function names and parameter naming to improve clarity and maintainability.
	•	DOM Element Caching: Cache frequently queried DOM elements (such as modal containers and close buttons) to reduce overhead on repeated DOM lookups during interactions.
	•	User Feedback on Errors: Implement UI-level error notifications when critical functions (e.g., loading an audio buffer or initializing the trimmer) fail, rather than relying solely on console error messages.
