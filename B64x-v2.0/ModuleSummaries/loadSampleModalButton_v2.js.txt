Filename: loadSampleModalButton_v2.js

Overview:
This file provides a comprehensive set of utility functions and UI components for managing a dropdown menu of “OG Audional sample inscriptions” along with associated modal dialogs and context menus. Its primary role is to allow users to select, load, and manage audio samples from predefined URLs. The file also handles channel naming, copying/pasting of channel configurations, and centralized modal management, integrating these features with the global sequencer settings.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	ogSampleUrls: An array of objects containing value (URL) and text (display name) for each available OG Audional sample inscription.
	•	AppState: A centralized state object that maintains an array of currently open modals.
	•	Utility Functions:
	•	createElement(type, className, attributes): Creates and configures a DOM element with optional classes and attributes.
	•	createModal(content): Generates a modal overlay that closes when clicking outside the modal content.
	•	closeModal(modalOverlay) & closeAllModals(): Functions to close a single modal or all open modals, respectively.
	•	showVisualMessage(message): Displays a temporary visual notification on the screen.
	•	handleError(context, error, userMessage): Standardized error logging and user notification.
	•	Modal & Input Helpers:
	•	createInputFields(fields, width), createDropdown(labelText, options, width, index), createActionButtons(actions): Functions that generate structured UI components for modals.
	•	Channel Operations & Context Menu Functions:
	•	openLoadSampleModal(index, loadSampleButton): Opens a modal to load a new audio sample, using input fields and a dropdown populated with ogSampleUrls.
	•	handleLoad(index, event, loadSampleButton): Processes the user input from the modal and determines the correct URL to load.
	•	processLoad(url, sampleName, index, loadSampleButton, modal): Fetches the audio sample and updates the global sequencer settings accordingly.
	•	showCustomContextMenu(event, channelIndex, loadSampleButton) and handleContextMenu(event, channelIndex, loadSampleButton): Create and manage a custom context menu for additional channel actions (e.g., renaming, copy/paste).
	•	showChannelNamingModal(channelIndex, loadSampleButton): Displays a modal to allow users to rename a channel.
	•	copyChannel(channelIndex) and pasteChannel(channelIndex, loadSampleButton): Functions to copy and paste channel configuration data using the Clipboard API.
	•	Setup Function:
	•	setupLoadSampleButton(channel, index): Initializes the load sample button for a given channel, binding click and context menu events.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	DOM Manipulation & Event Handling: Utilizes native JavaScript methods (e.g., document.createElement, addEventListener) for creating, modifying, and managing UI components and events.
	•	Modular Design: The file organizes functions into logical groups (utility, modal creation, event handlers, channel operations) to facilitate reusability and maintainability.
	•	Centralized State Management: Uses a global AppState object and interacts with window.unifiedSequencerSettings to ensure consistency between UI elements and the application’s core state.
	•	Error Handling and User Feedback: Incorporates standardized error handling functions and visual notifications to improve user experience and ease debugging.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Dynamic Modal Generation: The file dynamically creates modals for various purposes (sample loading, channel naming) with custom input fields, dropdowns, and action buttons, allowing for a flexible and user-friendly interface.
	•	Custom Context Menu: Implements a custom right-click context menu on load sample buttons to offer additional channel operations such as renaming and copying/pasting settings.
	•	Clipboard API Integration: Leverages the Clipboard API for copying and pasting channel configuration data, with a fallback mechanism in case the API is not supported.
	•	Utility Function Abstraction: Functions like createElement and createActionButtons abstract common DOM operations, ensuring consistency in styling and behavior across the application.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Code Modularization: Consider splitting the file into separate modules (e.g., one for modal management, one for channel operations, one for context menus) to enhance maintainability and facilitate unit testing.
	•	DOM Caching: Cache frequently accessed DOM elements (such as modal containers and buttons) to reduce repeated queries and improve performance.
	•	Enhanced Accessibility: Add ARIA attributes and improve keyboard navigation support for modals and dropdowns to ensure better accessibility.
	•	Refactor Repetitive Code: Consolidate similar event handlers or UI creation patterns into more generic utility functions to reduce code duplication and simplify future updates.
	•	Performance Improvements: Evaluate the use of inline styles in modal creation and consider moving these styles to a dedicated CSS file or class-based styling to improve load times and maintainability.
