# Suggested Enhancements for X0X Drum & Bass

## Functionality
- **Bass Sequencer:** Add a step sequencer for the bass line (currently manual play only).
- **Sample Import:** Allow users to drag-and-drop their own drum samples.
- **Polyrhythms:** Allow different step lengths for each drum track (e.g., Hi-hats running 12 steps against 16).

## Creative Utility
- **Breakbeat Slicer:** Instead of one-shots, allow loading a breakbeat loop and triggering slices.
- **Parameter Locks:** Per-step parameter changes for drums (e.g., changing pitch of the snare on step 4).

## User Experience
- **Mute/Solo:** Dedicated Mute/Solo buttons for each mixer channel.
- **Swing:** Global swing/shuffle control to add groove.
