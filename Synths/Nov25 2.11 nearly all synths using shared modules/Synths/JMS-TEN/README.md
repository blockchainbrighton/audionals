# KORG MS-10+ Emulator

## Overview
A web-based tribute to the classic Korg MS-10 semi-modular synthesizer. It captures the gritty, raw character of the original with a single VCO, the famous Korg-35 filter emulation, and a modulation patch bay simulation.

## Unique Features
- **Authentic Control Set:** Footage (32', 16', 8', 4'), Pulse Width, and Hold controls.
- **MS-10 Filter:** Aggressive Lowpass filter with high resonance capabilities.
- **Modulation Generator:** Frequency and Waveform controls for the LFO.
- **Patching Simulation:** While not fully modular cables, it simulates the routing flexibility via dedicated "Mod Amount" knobs for Filter and Pitch.

## Architecture
- **VCO:** Saw/Tri/Pulse/Noise.
- **VCF:** Lowpass (switchable Highpass in emulator?).
- **EG:** HADSR (Hold, Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) configuration.
- **MG:** LFO with multiple waveforms.
