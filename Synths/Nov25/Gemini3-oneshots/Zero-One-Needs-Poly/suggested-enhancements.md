# Suggested Enhancements for ZERO-ONE Lead

## Functionality
- **Unison/Supersaw:** Add a "Spread" knob to detune multiple voice layers for that classic trance lead sound.
- **Legato/Retrigger:** Toggle between Legato (smooth glide) and Retrigger envelope modes.

## Creative Utility
- **Step Modulator:** A simple 8-step sequencer that modulates pitch or cutoff, allowing for "gated" trance effects.
- **Scale Lock:** Quantize the keyboard input to specific scales to prevent wrong notes during fast solos.

## User Experience
- **Touch Support:** Enhance the pitch bend bar to be touch-interactive on mobile devices.
- **MIDI Learn:** Allow users to map physical knobs to on-screen controls.
