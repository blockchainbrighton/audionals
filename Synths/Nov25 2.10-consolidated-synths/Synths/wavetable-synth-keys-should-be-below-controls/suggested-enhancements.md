# Suggested Enhancements for Texture Pads

## Functionality
- **True Wavetables:** Implement actual wavetable synthesis using `Tone.Waveform` or buffer manipulation for more complex timbres.
- **Granular Mode:** Add a granular engine to freeze and texture input samples.

## Creative Utility
- **XY Pad:** A 2D control pad to morph between the three Macros (Brightness, Motion, Space).
- **Drone Mode:** A latch/hold button that sustains notes infinitely for ambient drones.

## User Experience
- **Spectrum Analyzer:** A frequency spectrum view to see the harmonic content of the morphing.
- **Backgrounds:** Dynamic background colors that change based on the "Morph" position.
