# Suggested Enhancements for NEON HORIZON

## Functionality
- **Tape Saturation:** Add a "VHS" effect with wow, flutter, and noise to simulate old cassette tapes.
- **Chord Mode:** One-finger chord triggering (Major/Minor 7ths) for instant pads.

## Creative Utility
- **Drift Control:** A global "Analog Drift" knob that randomizes pitch and filter per voice.
- **Gated Reverb:** A specific reverb mode for those 80s snare/perc sounds (if drums are added) or rhythmic pads.

## User Experience
- **Visualizer Options:** Toggle between different 80s grid landscapes (Grid, Sun, Cityscape).
- **Skinning:** Allow changing the neon color palette (e.g., Cyberpunk Yellow, Vaporwave Pink).
