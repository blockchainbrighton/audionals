# Suggested Enhancements for MS-10+

## Functionality
- **Virtual Patch Cables:** Implement a visual drag-and-drop cable system to connect patch points (e.g., LFO Out -> Filter Cutoff In).
- **External Audio In:** Allow using the user's microphone as an input source to process audio through the filter (a key MS-10 feature).

## Creative Utility
- **SQ-10 Sequencer:** Add a companion sequencer module to drive the synth, mimicking the classic MS-10/SQ-10 pairing.
- **Sample & Hold:** Add a S&H module for random "computer processing" bleeps and bloops.

## User Experience
- **Skeuomorphic Design:** Enhance the UI to look even more like the original hardware panel.
- **Manual:** A built-in "Patch Book" showing how to create classic sounds (Bass, Lead, FX).
