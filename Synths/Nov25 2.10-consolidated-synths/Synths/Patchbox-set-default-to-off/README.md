# Ordinal Patchbox Modular

## Overview
A semi-modular synthesizer featuring a "Modulation Matrix" grid. This synth allows for complex sound design by routing various modulation sources (LFOs, Envelopes, Velocity) to different destinations (Pitch, Cutoff, Shape, Delay) via a grid interface.

## Unique Features
- **Modulation Matrix:** A 5x5 grid allowing precise attenuation of modulation routing.
- **Dual Oscillators:** Two oscillators with mix and noise controls.
- **Arpeggiator:** Built-in arpeggiator with toggle.
- **Oscilloscope:** Real-time waveform visualization.
- **Flexible Routing:** Easily create complex evolving textures or rhythmic effects.

## Architecture
- **Sources:** LFO 1, LFO 2, Mod Envelope, Velocity.
- **Destinations:** Pitch, Filter Cutoff, Shape/PWM, Delay Time, LFO Rate.
- **Filter:** Multimode (LP/HP/BP).
