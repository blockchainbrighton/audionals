## Earnings Potential

### How Much Can You Earn?

**Example Scenario 1: Business Blog**
A blog focused on entrepreneurship with 15,000 monthly visitors could reasonably convert 0.3% of visitors to Shopify trials. With a 25% trial-to-paid conversion rate and an average commission of $100 (mix of different plans), that's:

**15,000 × 0.3% × 25% × $100 = $1,125 monthly commission**

**Example Scenario 2: YouTube Channel**
A YouTube channel with 10,000 subscribers creating content about starting online businesses could convert viewers through tutorial videos showcasing Shopify. With just 10 conversions per month at an average commission of $100:

**10 conversions × $100 = $1,000 monthly commission**

**Example Scenario 3: Instagram Influence**
An Instagram account with 20,000 followers focused on entrepreneurship could promote Shopify through posts and stories. With a conservative 0.1% conversion rate:

**20,000 × 0.1% × $100 = $2,000 monthly commission**
