## Tracking Technologies

### Cookies and Web Beacons
We use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Site to help customize the Site and improve your experience. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. When you access the Site, your personal information is not automatically collected through the use of basic tracking technology without your consent (e.g., for analytics or essential site functions). Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Site. For more information on how we use cookies, please refer to our Cookie Policy (if you have one) or contact us.

### Website Analytics
*[USER: Verify and list ONLY the analytics vendors you ACTUALLY use. Remove/add as needed.]*
We partner with selected third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Site through the use of first-party cookies and third-party cookies. This helps us analyze and track users’ use of the Site, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand online activity. By accessing the Site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors directly from our site beyond what is collected by their scripts. If you do not want any information to be collected and used by tracking technologies, you can visit the third-party vendor or the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.

### Affiliate Links
Our website contains affiliate links. When you click on an affiliate link, a cookie will likely be placed on your browser by the third-party affiliate network or merchant to track any resulting sales for purposes of commissions. These cookies are governed by the privacy policies of the respective affiliate programs/networks.

## Third-Party Websites

The Site contains links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including affiliate partners, advertisements, and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Site, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information.

## Security of Your Information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

## Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this time, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
