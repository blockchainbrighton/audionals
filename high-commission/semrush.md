## Earnings Potential

### How Much Can You Earn?

**Example Scenario 1: Niche Website**
A niche website with 10,000 monthly visitors focused on digital marketing topics could reasonably convert 0.5% of visitors to Semrush trials. With a 30% trial-to-paid conversion rate, that's 15 paid subscriptions per month.

**15 conversions × $200 = $3,000 monthly commission**

**Example Scenario 2: YouTube Channel**
A YouTube channel with 5,000 subscribers publishing SEO tutorials could convert viewers through tutorial videos demonstrating Semrush features. With just 5 conversions per month:

**5 conversions × $200 = $1,000 monthly commission**

**Example Scenario 3: Email Newsletter**
A marketing newsletter with 2,000 subscribers could promote Semrush through dedicated emails and content integrations. With a conservative 0.2% conversion rate:

**4 conversions × $200 = $800 monthly commission**
