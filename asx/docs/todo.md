# Timing Audit & Optimization Todo List

## Phase 1: Repository Access and Initial Exploration
- [x] Clone the repository
- [x] Explore the directory structure
- [x] Identify key files and components
- [x] Document the initial findings

## Phase 2: Codebase Analysis and Structure Understanding
- [x] Analyze the main code files
- [x] Identify programming languages and audio libraries used
- [x] Understand the architecture and data flow
- [x] Document the system components and their interactions

## Phase 3: Timing Issues Identification and Analysis
- [x] Identify time sources and their resolution/drift
- [x] Analyze scheduling mechanisms (queues, timers, triggers)
- [x] Review audio callback implementation
- [x] Examine thread management and IPC
- [x] Map latency and jitter sources
- [x] Analyze synchronization primitives
- [x] Review external I/O handling (MIDI, plugins, clock sync)

## Phase 4: Refactoring Plan Development
- [x] Identify critical timing issues
- [x] Develop solutions for each identified issue
- [x] Prioritize fixes based on impact and complexity
- [x] Create a roadmap for implementation

## Phase 5: Final Report Compilation and Delivery
- [x] Write executive summary
- [x] Document current architecture with diagrams
- [x] Create module reports for each file
- [x] Compile global issues and patterns
- [x] Finalize refactoring plan
- [x] Suggest testing and validation approaches
- [x] Identify potential risks
- [x] Compile final report in Markdown format
