# 7-Hour Twitter Momentum Plan for **AudioGNARLS** Launch 🚀

## Overview: Goals & Strategy

In the final 7 hours before launch, the aim is to keep a steady drumbeat of hype and engagement. Post regularly (every 30–45 minutes) with a mix of **countdown reminders, synth sneak peeks, community shout-outs, and interactive prompts**. We want to mobilize whitelisted holders (both the **256 Guaranteed WL** and the **\~1500 Holders WL**) while also sparking broader interest for the public sale. Leverage your **GIFs/videos** and coordinate with **community leaders** to amplify reach—ask leaders to **repost/quote** so their members see it.
Variety is key: alternate between **pure hype**, **informative on-chain BVST details** (programmable, savable, recursive, seed-driven), and **questions that get followers talking about on-chain synths and AudioGNARLS**. Keep the tone **excited and inclusive** (fun emojis, gratitude, FOMO) so even non-WL folks tune in.

## Final Tips

* **Consistency & Timing**: Keep the cadence; lean into post types that perform well.
* **Engage Back**: Like/reply/RT community posts (“Just minted!”) to stack social proof.
* **Smart Hashtags/Emojis**: #AudioGNARLS #BVST #OnChainSynth #Ordinals #Bitcoin | 🎛️🎶⚡️⏳🔥
* **Mix Info & Fun**: Alternate tech facts (programmable/savable/recursive) with hype.
* **Schedule**: Pre-schedule countdowns/media so you can **focus on replies and real-time updates** during the windows.

By combining **countdowns, WL activation, BVST education, visual teasers, and FOMO cues**, you’ll sustain momentum through Guaranteed → Holders → Public, keeping attention on **AudioGNARLS as a programmable, on-chain BVST synth you can actually use**.
