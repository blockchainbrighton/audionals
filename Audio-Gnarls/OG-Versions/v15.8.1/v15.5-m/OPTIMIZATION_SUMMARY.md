## 2025-09-07 — v15.7 (AudioWorklet + Warning Fixes)

- **AudioWorklet status:** Worklet is **active**. We now run oscillator DSP off the main thread via `AudioWorkletNode('dsp-processor')`.
- **Tone integration:** Instead of overwriting a read-only `Tone.Oscillator`, we install an AW-backed oscillator at `Tone.__Oscillator`, and the engine instantiates `new (Tone.__Oscillator || Tone.Oscillator)(...)` — making the patch transparent and robust against read-only properties.
- **Suspended AudioContext warning fixed:** Added a user-gesture bootstrap in `index.html` that calls `Tone.start()` or resumes the `AudioContext`, eliminating the “AudioContext is suspended” console warning on first interaction.
- **Meta tag deprecation resolved:** Replaced deprecated `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` with `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">`.
- **Logging:** Console now reports when the AudioWorklet-backed oscillator is installed:  
  `[AW Bridge] Installed AudioWorklet-backed oscillator via Tone.__Oscillator (engine uses it transparently)`

**Notes:**  
These upgrades improve determinism and reduce glitching under UI load. If `audioWorklet` is unavailable, the system falls back automatically to the original oscillator with no code changes in the app logic.

## 2025-09-07 — v15.8 (Lazy Tone import to suppress suspended warning)

- **Lazy-load Tone on first user gesture** via `ToneLoader`: defers dynamic import of Tone until a pointer/key event to avoid the early “AudioContext is suspended” warning before the user interacts.
- **Meta cleanup:** ensured *all* occurrences of the deprecated apple meta are removed.
- **Status:** AudioWorklet-backed oscillator remains active through `Tone.__Oscillator` path.
