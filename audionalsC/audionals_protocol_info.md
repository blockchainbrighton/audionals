# Audionals Protocol Research

## What are Audionals?

Audionals is a pioneering protocol that transforms music production, distribution, and rights management by offering an on-chain digital audio workstation (DAW) built on the Bitcoin blockchain. By fully operating within a decentralized on-chain environment, Audionals redefines Web3 music. This entirely on-chain approach guarantees that every facet of music creation, collaboration, and ownership is securely managed and transparently documented on the blockchain, creating an immutable and trustless ecosystem for artists and producers.

## Key Features

1. **True Web3 Composition**: Each song created with the Audionals protocol is a true Web3 composition, existing solely through programmatic assembly in a single-domain, on-chain environment. The output files, known as Bitcoin Audionals, are immutable recordings that encapsulate the entire creation process. When executed, these files programmatically generate the song using the on-chain resources.

2. **Revolutionary Rights Management**: Every element involved in a song's creation—such as vocal recordings, keyboard parts, and plugin codes—is owned and held within individual wallets. The song file itself serves as an immutable Merkle tree that references each component's wallet address and rights holder. This eliminates the need for traditional contractual agreements and legal intermediaries, as the song file inherently represents all associated rights.

3. **Embedded Rights Structure**: Audionals redefines how music is created, owned, and distributed by embedding rights directly into the song's digital structure. This ensures transparency, immutability, and decentralized ownership, paving the way for a new era of music production in the Web3 landscape.

4. **Accessibility and Innovation**: Audionals is revolutionizing the music industry by making blockchain technology affordable and accessible to all musicians. This innovation liberates artists from the burden of high file sizes and costs, paving the way for an era of unparalleled creativity and innovation for audial artists on the Bitcoin blockchain.

5. **Comprehensive Attribution**: By integrating all elements of music production into the blockchain, the Audionals protocol ensures comprehensive and transparent attribution for every component used in creating a song. This means that not only are composers and sample holders recognized, but so are the contributions of those using specific effects and tools.

## On-Chain Sequencer

The website features an "Audional Sequencer" called "BitcoinBeats Beta" which appears to be a digital audio workstation (DAW) that operates directly on the blockchain. This sequencer allows users to create and mix raw on-chain audio, with features including:

- BPM control
- Play/Stop functionality
- Save/Load/Copy/Paste options
- Multiple audio tracks with sequencing capabilities
- Sample loading
- Sequence navigation

The interface indicates that this is a tool for "Raw On-chain Bitcoin Audionals: playing live, directly from the Blockchain!"
