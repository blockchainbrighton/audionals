# Audionals JSON Standard Research

## New JSON Standard

The Audionals protocol introduces a comprehensive JSON structure for capturing every essential detail of a digital audio file, incorporating audio and exhaustive metadata into a single, on-chain playable file. Key aspects include:

1. **Comprehensive Structure**: The JSON format includes metadata, technical information, contextual insights, preservation history, administrative data, and user-defined fields, providing a unified solution for organizing and accessing on-chain audio assets.

2. **Base64 Audio Integration**: What truly sets this format apart is the integration of base64 audio-encoding within the JSON file itself. This eliminates the need for separate metadata files when current options are restrictive in standards like mp3, wav, or flac, creating more efficient files for integration into dApp applications with on-chain capabilities.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The Audionals protocol enhances compatibility across diverse platforms, software, and devices. Regardless of the location or tools used, this format guarantees a consistent, hassle-free experience. It ensures that inscribed audio files can seamlessly integrate into various inscribed applications, allowing users to harness their audio resources effortlessly, working entirely on-chain.

4. **Permanent Storage and Indexing**: Audionals establishes a new benchmark for permanent audio file storage and indexing for future access. Organizing, categorizing, and retrieving audio files becomes effortless with reduced administrative pressure for future users, empowering them with an intuitive system that ensures seamless, perpetual access to immutable audio resources.

5. **Global Resource Library**: With UTF-8 encoding, Audionals JSON files not only create a global resource library that transcends language barriers but also provides the tools for preserving our varied and wonderful global linguistic heritage itself. The protocol provides an immutable audio record for an audial seed bank for safeguarding endangered languages, phonetics, and dialects for all of humanity and future generations.

The Audionals protocol began as an innovative standard for the indexing and standardization of audio files inscribed as text strings on the Bitcoin blockchain and has grown to become a cutting-edge standard for bringing a multitude of benefits to the digital creative industries such as music and film.
