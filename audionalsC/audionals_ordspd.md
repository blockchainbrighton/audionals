# Audionals OrdSPD Research

## OrdSPD Overview

The OrdSPD (Ordinal Sample Pad Device) is an on-chain sequencer and audio workstation that appears to be a core component of the Audionals protocol. Based on the interface exploration, it has the following features:

1. **Audional Sample Pad**: A grid-based interface for creating and mixing audio samples directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

2. **Regenerative Bitcoin Ordinal Mixer**: Described as a "Regenerative Bitcoin Ordinal Mixer for Audional Smart Samples," suggesting it can combine and manipulate audio samples that exist as Bitcoin Ordinals.

3. **BPM Control**: Users can set and adjust the global BPM (Beats Per Minute) for their compositions.

4. **Sample Management**: The interface includes options to:
   - Save compositions
   - Load existing compositions
   - Generate random mixes
   - Clear all pads

5. **Visual Interface**: The sequencer includes visual representations of audio samples with pixel art characters/icons that appear to represent different sound elements.

6. **Hotkeys and Shortcuts**: The interface includes keyboard shortcuts for various functions:
   - `-` / `+`: Adjust loop length
   - `0`: Return to default loop length
   - `<` / `>`: Adjust volume
   - `m`: Mute

The OrdSPD appears to be a specialized tool for creating, mixing, and managing on-chain audio in the form of Bitcoin Ordinals, allowing for direct manipulation of audio data that exists on the blockchain.
