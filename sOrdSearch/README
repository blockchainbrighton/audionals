sOrdinals Search Engine: README
Overview
The sOrdinals Search Engine is a web-based application designed to facilitate the search and display of s-ordinal non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using various identifiers such as the Inscription Number, Inscription ID (Hash), Owner Address, and Parent ID. The search engine is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging APIs from the sOrdinals blockchain platform.

Installation and Setup
To run the sOrdinals Search Engine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files directly.
Ensure you have a web server setup (like Apache or Nginx) or use a simple HTTP server.
Place the project files into your web server’s public directory.
Open a web browser and navigate to the location where you've hosted the files.
Usage Guide
User Interface
The interface is divided into two main columns:

Left Column: Contains input fields and buttons for initiating searches.
Right Column: Displays an iframe for rendering content related to the search results, such as images.
Search Functions
Users can search for s-ordinal NFTs using one of the following methods:

By Inscription Number: Enter the inscription number in the designated input field and click the corresponding search button.
By Inscription Hash: Enter the inscription ID (hash) in the designated input field and click the corresponding search button.
By Owner Address: Enter the owner’s wallet address in the designated input field to retrieve all inscriptions associated with that address.
By Parent ID: Enter the parent ID to search for all child inscriptions linked to a specific parent.
Each search input field has an associated onkeypress event that triggers the search when the Enter key is pressed.

Key Components
HTML Structure
The main HTML page (index.html) defines the structure and layout of the application, including input fields, buttons, and sections for displaying search results.

CSS
The styles.css file should contain all the styles for the application, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript
The functionality of the search engine is primarily handled through JavaScript, split across two main files:

main.js: Contains the core logic for fetching data from the API, handling user input, and updating the UI.
iframe.js: Manages iframe interactions, such as loading content and adjusting the iframe size.
Detailed Function Explanations
fetchData(url, sectionId, title)
This asynchronous function fetches data from a specified URL. It handles network responses, updates the UI with the data or error messages, and triggers additional functions if necessary (e.g., fetching child inscription details).

displayData(sectionId, title, data, isParent)
Updates the designated section of the webpage with details from the fetched data. If the data includes a file URL and it's marked as a parent inscription, the function will also manage iframe content loading.

adjustIframeSize(iframe)
Adjusts the height of the iframe to match its content, ensuring that the display is visually appropriate.

getDetails(type, inputValue)
Initiates a data fetch operation based on the type of identifier provided (e.g., number, hash, owner, parent) and the input value. It maps inputs to the correct API endpoints and updates the UI accordingly.

handleKeypress(e, type)
Listens for the 'Enter' keypress event on input fields, preventing the default form submission behavior and triggering a search operation instead.

Conclusion
The sOrdinals Search Engine is a powerful tool for exploring s-ordinal NFTs directly from a web browser. By following the above guidelines, users can effectively utilize the search engine to query and display NFT details based on different identifiers, enhancing their experience with the sOrdinals blockchain.
