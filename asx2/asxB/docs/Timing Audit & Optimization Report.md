## Executive Summary

The Audional Sequencer is a web-based digital audio workstation (DAW) focused on step sequencing and sample manipulation. This audit was conducted to identify timing issues in the codebase and provide a prioritized refactoring plan to achieve professional-grade, sample-accurate timing.

The audit revealed several critical timing issues:

1. **Scheduler Reliability**: The current scheduler relies on `setTimeout` for timing, which is known to be imprecise in browser environments.
2. **Fixed Look-Ahead Window**: The fixed look-ahead window (0.1s) may not be optimal for all scenarios and could lead to audio gaps if the main thread is blocked.
3. **Complex Audio Graph Creation**: For each scheduled step, a new audio processing chain is created with multiple nodes, which could introduce latency.
4. **UI Updates in State Subscribers**: UI updates are triggered by state changes, which could cause jitter if they take too long to process.
5. **Limited Timing Metrics**: While there is some timing debugging code, it's limited in scope and doesn't provide comprehensive metrics.

The refactoring plan addresses these issues with a prioritized approach:

1. **Critical Fixes**:
   - Implement a high-precision scheduler using `requestAnimationFrame`
   - Implement an adaptive look-ahead window
   - Implement Audio Worklets for complex processing
   - Implement comprehensive timing metrics

2. **High Priority Fixes**:
   - Implement audio node pooling and reuse
   - Implement deferred and prioritized UI updates
   - Move the scheduler to a dedicated worker thread
   - Optimize AudioContext configuration

3. **Medium Priority Fixes**:
   - Implement drift detection and compensation
   - Optimize canvas rendering with caching
   - Implement a buffer management system
   - Implement specific handling for background tab throttling

4. **Low Priority Fixes**:
   - Implement a sample preloading strategy
   - Implement a comprehensive performance profiling system
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms
   - Improve documentation and comments

By implementing these recommendations, the Audional Sequencer should achieve the target performance of <10ms round-trip latency, <1ms scheduling jitter, and sample-accurate internal timing.

## Current Architecture

### System Overview

The Audional Sequencer follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **State Management**: Centralized state management using a custom publish-subscribe pattern.
2. **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API-based audio processing and playback.
3. **UI System**: DOM-based UI rendering and event handling.
4. **Utilities**: Helper functions for sample loading, file handling, etc.

The application is structured around the following key components:

- **state.js**: Centralized state management
- **audioCore.js**: Web Audio API setup and configuration
- **audioEngine.js**: Facade for the audio engine
- **playbackEngine.js**: Sequencer logic and audio scheduling
- **ui.js**: UI orchestration and rendering
- **channelUI.js**: Channel-specific UI management
- **waveformDisplay.js**: Canvas-based waveform visualization
- **utils.js**: Utility functions for sample loading, etc.

### Audio Processing Pipeline

The audio processing pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Sample Loading**: Audio samples are loaded from various sources (local files, URLs, Ordinals) and decoded into AudioBuffers.

2. **Sequencer Logic**: The sequencer determines which steps should be played based on the current time and BPM.

3. **Audio Scheduling**: Audio events are scheduled ahead of time using the Web Audio API's timing model.

4. **Audio Processing**: For each scheduled step, an audio processing chain is created with various effects nodes.

5. **Playback**: Audio is played through the Web Audio API's audio graph, with gain nodes for volume control.

The pipeline is driven by a scheduler that runs periodically to schedule upcoming audio events:

```javascript
function scheduler() {
  const nowCtx = ctx.currentTime;
  
  while (nextStepTime < nowCtx + lookAhead) {
    // Schedule steps
    scheduleStep(_currentSchedulerStep, nextStepTime, barStep);
    
    // Advance to next step
    nextStepTime += secondsPer16thNote;
    _currentSchedulerStep = (_currentSchedulerStep + 1) % patternLength;
  }
  
  // Update UI
  const displayStep = getCurrentStepFromContextTime(nowCtx, s.bpm);
  State.update({ currentStep: displayStep });
  
  // Schedule next call
  timerId = setTimeout(scheduler, scheduleAheadTime * 1000);
}
```

### Timing Flow Diagram

The timing flow in the Audional Sequencer can be represented as follows:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  User Input  │────▶│  State Update │────▶│  UI Update   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Scheduler   │◀───▶│ Audio Context │────▶│  Audio Output │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
      │                    ▲
      ▼                    │
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Step Scheduling │────▶│ Audio Processing │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

Key timing interactions:

1. **User Input → State Update**: User actions (e.g., play button, BPM change) update the central state.
2. **State Update → UI Update**: State changes trigger UI updates via the publish-subscribe pattern.
3. **State Update → Scheduler**: State changes (e.g., play/stop) affect the scheduler operation.
4. **Scheduler → Step Scheduling**: The scheduler determines which steps to play and when.
5. **Step Scheduling → Audio Processing**: Scheduled steps trigger audio processing chain creation.
6. **Audio Processing → Audio Context**: Processed audio is sent to the Audio Context for playback.
7. **Audio Context → Audio Output**: The Audio Context sends audio to the output device.
8. **Audio Context → Scheduler**: The scheduler uses Audio Context time for scheduling.
9. **Scheduler → UI Update**: The scheduler updates the UI with the current step.

This flow highlights the critical timing dependencies in the system, particularly the reliance on the scheduler for coordinating audio playback and UI updates.



## Timing Issues Analysis

### Time Sources

The Audional Sequencer relies on several time sources for scheduling and synchronization:

#### Primary Time Source: AudioContext.currentTime

The Web Audio API's `AudioContext.currentTime` is the primary time source used for scheduling audio events:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
const nowCtx = ctx.currentTime;
// ...
source.start(scheduledEventTime, startOffset, durationToPlay);
```

**Issues**:
- **Precision Variability**: While `AudioContext.currentTime` provides high-precision timing in theory (microsecond level), its actual precision can vary across browsers and platforms.
- **No Drift Compensation**: There is no mechanism to detect or compensate for potential drift between the audio clock and the system clock.
- **Limited Access**: The actual output time (when audio is heard) is not directly accessible, only the scheduled time.

**Impact**:
- Variations in timing precision across different browsers and devices
- Potential for increasing timing inaccuracies over long playback sessions
- Difficulty in synchronizing audio events with visual feedback

#### Secondary Time Source: performance.now()

The `performance.now()` API is used for measuring scheduler execution time and debugging:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
const schedulerEntryTimePerf = performance.now();
// ...
const schedulerTotalExecutionTimePerf = performance.now() - schedulerEntryTimePerf;
```

**Issues**:
- **No Synchronization**: There is no synchronization between `performance.now()` and `AudioContext.currentTime`.
- **Throttling**: In some browsers, `performance.now()` may be throttled or reduced in precision for security reasons.
- **Limited Use**: It's only used for debugging and performance monitoring, not for actual audio scheduling.

**Impact**:
- Difficulty in accurately measuring and optimizing scheduler performance
- Potential for misleading performance metrics
- Missed opportunities for time source synchronization

#### Derived Time Values

Several derived time values are used throughout the codebase:

- **nextStepTime**: The time for the next step to be scheduled
- **playStartTime**: The time when playback started
- **scheduledEventTime**: The time when a specific audio event should start

**Issues**:
- **Calculation Complexity**: Derived time values involve calculations that could introduce rounding errors.
- **No Validation**: There is no validation or correction of derived time values.
- **Inconsistent Usage**: Different parts of the code may use different time references.

**Impact**:
- Potential for cumulative timing errors
- Difficulty in debugging timing issues
- Inconsistent timing behavior across different parts of the application

### Scheduling Mechanisms

The Audional Sequencer uses a look-ahead scheduler to schedule audio events ahead of time:

#### Scheduler Loop

The scheduler loop is implemented in `playbackEngine.js` and is responsible for scheduling audio events:

```javascript
function scheduler() {
  // ...
  while (nextStepTime < nowCtx + lookAhead) {
    // Schedule steps
    // ...
    nextStepTime += secondsPer16thNote;
  }
  // ...
  timerId = setTimeout(scheduler, scheduleAheadTime * 1000);
}
```

**Issues**:
- **setTimeout Reliability**: The scheduler relies on `setTimeout` for timing, which is known to be imprecise in browser environments.
- **Fixed Parameters**: The scheduler uses fixed values for `lookAhead` (0.1s) and `scheduleAheadTime` (0.2s), which may not be optimal for all scenarios.
- **Main Thread Execution**: The scheduler runs on the main thread, which could be blocked by UI updates and other operations.

**Impact**:
- Jitter in scheduler execution (1-10ms)
- Potential for audio gaps if the main thread is blocked for longer than the look-ahead window
- Reduced responsiveness to tempo changes

#### Step Scheduling

For each step that needs to be played, the `scheduleStep` function creates and schedules the audio processing chain:

```javascript
function scheduleStep(stepIdx, scheduledEventTime, scheduledStepOfBar) {
  // ...
  const source = ctx.createBufferSource();
  // ... (create and connect audio nodes)
  source.start(scheduledEventTime, startOffset, durationToPlay);
  // ...
}
```

**Issues**:
- **Complex Audio Graph Creation**: For each scheduled step, a new audio processing chain is created with multiple nodes.
- **No Node Reuse**: Audio nodes are created and discarded for each step, rather than being reused.
- **Synchronization Challenges**: Multiple parameters need to be synchronized to the same time reference.

**Impact**:
- Increased latency due to audio node creation
- Potential for garbage collection pauses affecting timing
- Complexity in ensuring all parameters are synchronized

#### UI Update Mechanism

UI updates are triggered by state changes, which are often initiated by the scheduler:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
State.update({ currentStep: displayStep });

// From ui.js
State.subscribe(render);
```

**Issues**:
- **Synchronous Updates**: UI updates are performed synchronously, potentially blocking the main thread.
- **No Prioritization**: There is no prioritization of timing-critical operations over UI updates.
- **Render Performance**: The render function performs potentially expensive DOM operations.

**Impact**:
- UI updates could block the main thread and affect scheduler timing
- Jitter in audio playback due to inconsistent scheduler execution
- Poor performance under high load

### Audio Callback Implementation

The Web Audio API uses a callback-based approach for audio processing, with the actual processing happening in a separate audio thread:

#### Audio Node Creation and Connection

For each scheduled step, a new audio processing chain is created:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
const source = ctx.createBufferSource();
source.buffer = bufferToPlay;
source.playbackRate.value = Math.pow(2, (ch.pitch || 0) / 12);

// ... (create and connect filter nodes, EQ nodes, etc.)

currentNode.connect(gain);
gain.connect(channelGainNodes[channelIndex]);
```

**Issues**:
- **Creation Overhead**: Creating and connecting audio nodes for each step introduces overhead.
- **No Audio Worklets**: The codebase doesn't use Audio Worklets for complex processing.
- **Limited Error Handling**: There is limited error handling for audio processing failures.

**Impact**:
- Increased latency due to node creation and connection
- Potential for audio glitches under high load
- Difficulty in recovering from audio processing errors

#### Parameter Automation

Audio parameters are automated using the Web Audio API's parameter automation methods:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
gain.gain.setValueAtTime(0, scheduledEventTime);
gain.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, scheduledEventTime + fadeIn);
```

**Issues**:
- **Automation Complexity**: Complex parameter automation can be computationally expensive.
- **No Optimization**: There is no optimization for common parameter automation patterns.
- **Limited Validation**: There is limited validation of parameter values and timing.

**Impact**:
- Potential for increased CPU usage during parameter automation
- Risk of invalid parameter values causing audio artifacts
- Difficulty in debugging parameter automation issues

#### Callback Cleanup

Audio nodes are cleaned up in the `onended` callback:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
source.onended = () => {
  // ... (cleanup logic)
  cleanup.forEach(node => { try { node.disconnect(); } catch {} });
  // ...
};
```

**Issues**:
- **Callback Timing**: The `onended` callback may not be called at the exact time the audio ends.
- **Error Handling**: The cleanup code uses try-catch blocks that could hide errors.
- **State Update**: The callback updates the state, which could trigger UI updates.

**Impact**:
- Potential for memory leaks if cleanup fails
- Difficulty in tracking the actual end time of audio events
- UI updates triggered by cleanup could affect timing

### Thread Management

The Audional Sequencer operates within the browser's threading model, which includes:

#### Main Thread Usage

The main thread is responsible for:
- UI rendering and updates
- Event handling
- State management
- Scheduler execution
- Audio node creation and connection

**Issues**:
- **Overloaded Responsibilities**: The main thread handles too many responsibilities.
- **No Prioritization**: There is no prioritization of timing-critical operations.
- **Blocking Operations**: Several operations could block the main thread.

**Impact**:
- Main thread congestion affecting scheduler timing
- Jitter in audio playback due to inconsistent scheduler execution
- Poor performance under high load

#### Audio Thread Interaction

The audio thread is managed by the browser and is responsible for:
- Audio processing and playback
- Executing scheduled audio events
- Applying audio effects in real-time

**Issues**:
- **Limited Control**: There is limited control over the audio thread.
- **No Feedback**: There is no direct feedback from the audio thread to the main thread.
- **No Worklets**: The codebase doesn't use Audio Worklets for complex processing.

**Impact**:
- Difficulty in optimizing audio processing
- Limited visibility into audio thread performance
- Missed opportunities for offloading work from the main thread

#### Thread Communication

Communication between threads occurs through:
- Scheduling API (`AudioBufferSourceNode.start()`)
- Parameter automation (`AudioParam.setValueAtTime()`)
- Event callbacks (`onended`)

**Issues**:
- **Indirect Communication**: Communication is indirect and limited.
- **No Explicit Synchronization**: There is no explicit synchronization between threads.
- **Limited Error Handling**: There is limited error handling for thread communication failures.

**Impact**:
- Difficulty in ensuring synchronized operation
- Limited ability to recover from communication failures
- Missed opportunities for optimizing thread interaction

### Latency and Jitter Sources

The Audional Sequencer has several potential sources of latency and jitter:

#### Scheduling Latency

Scheduling latency is introduced by:
- The look-ahead window (0.1s)
- Scheduler execution time
- `setTimeout` reliability

**Issues**:
- **Fixed Look-Ahead**: The fixed look-ahead window doesn't adapt to system performance.
- **Scheduler Overhead**: The scheduler performs multiple operations that could take time.
- **setTimeout Jitter**: `setTimeout` can be delayed by various factors.

**Impact**:
- Minimum latency of 100ms due to the look-ahead window
- Additional jitter of 1-10ms due to `setTimeout` reliability
- Potential for audio gaps if the scheduler is delayed

#### Processing Latency

Processing latency is introduced by:
- Audio node creation and connection
- Audio processing (effects, etc.)
- Garbage collection

**Issues**:
- **Node Creation Overhead**: Creating and connecting audio nodes takes time.
- **Complex Processing**: Applying multiple effects increases processing time.
- **Garbage Collection**: Frequent node creation and disposal could trigger garbage collection.

**Impact**:
- Additional latency of 1-5ms per audio event
- Potential for audio glitches during garbage collection
- Increased CPU usage during complex processing

#### Driver Latency

Driver latency is introduced by:
- The Web Audio API's output latency
- Browser and platform variations
- Audio driver configuration

**Issues**:
- **Uncontrolled Latency**: The output latency is largely determined by the browser and platform.
- **No Optimization**: There is no attempt to optimize or measure the output latency.
- **No Adaptation**: There is no adaptation to different output latency values.

**Impact**:
- Additional latency of 10-50ms depending on the browser and platform
- Inconsistent timing across different devices
- Difficulty in achieving consistent low-latency performance

#### UI Latency

UI latency is introduced by:
- DOM updates
- Canvas rendering
- Event handling

**Issues**:
- **Synchronous Updates**: UI updates are performed synchronously.
- **Complex Rendering**: Canvas rendering for waveforms can be computationally expensive.
- **Event Handling Overhead**: Event handling can block the main thread.

**Impact**:
- Main thread blocking affecting scheduler timing
- Jitter in audio playback due to inconsistent scheduler execution
- Poor UI responsiveness under high load

### Synchronization Primitives

The Audional Sequencer uses several synchronization primitives:

#### State Management

The application uses a custom state management system with a publish-subscribe pattern:

```javascript
// From state.js
const emit = () => {
  listeners.forEach(l => l(state, prevState));
  prevState = { ...state }; 
};
```

**Issues**:
- **Synchronous Updates**: State updates are synchronous and could block the main thread.
- **No Prioritization**: There is no prioritization of state updates based on timing criticality.
- **No Batching**: There is no batching or debouncing of state updates.

**Impact**:
- State updates could block the main thread and affect scheduler timing
- Multiple state updates could trigger multiple UI updates
- No way to prioritize timing-critical state updates

#### Audio Event Synchronization

Audio events are synchronized using the Web Audio API's timing model:

```javascript
// From playbackEngine.js
source.start(scheduledEventTime, startOffset, durationToPlay);
```

**Issues**:
- **No Explicit Synchronization**: There is no explicit synchronization between different audio events.
- **No Compensation**: There is no compensation for potential timing inaccuracies.
- **No Feedback**: There is no feedback mechanism to verify actual execution timing.

**Impact**:
- Difficulty in ensuring synchronized playback of multiple audio events
- No way to detect or correct timing inaccuracies
- Limited visibility into actual audio event timing

#### UI Animation Synchronization

UI animations are synchronized using `requestAnimationFrame`:

```javascript
// From ui.js
function animateTransport() {
  // ... (playhead visualization logic)
  requestAnimationFrame(animateTransport);
}
```

**Issues**:
- **Separate Timing**: UI animations use a separate timing mechanism from audio events.
- **No Synchronization**: There is no explicit synchronization between UI animations and audio events.
- **Continuous Animation**: The animation frame loop runs continuously, which could consume resources unnecessarily.

**Impact**:
- Visual feedback may not accurately reflect audio playback
- Continuous animation could consume CPU resources
- Missed opportunities for optimizing animation based on audio timing

### External I/O Handling

The Audional Sequencer interacts with external I/O in several ways:

#### Sample Loading

Samples are loaded from various sources (local files, URLs, Ordinals):

```javascript
// From utils.js
export async function loadSample(source) {
  // ... (loading logic)
  const buffer = await ctx.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);
  return { buffer, imageData };
}
```

**Issues**:
- **Synchronous Decoding**: Audio decoding is performed on the main thread.
- **No Preloading**: There is no strategy for preloading or caching samples.
- **Limited Error Handling**: There is limited error handling for loading failures.

**Impact**:
- Sample loading could block the main thread
- Loading samples during playback could cause temporary performance degradation
- Difficulty in recovering from loading failures

#### User Interaction

User interactions are handled through standard DOM events:

```javascript
// From app.js
document.getElementById('play-btn').addEventListener('click', start);
document.getElementById('stop-btn').addEventListener('click', stop);
```

**Issues**:
- **Event Handling Overhead**: Event handling can block the main thread.
- **No Debouncing**: There is no debouncing or throttling of user interactions.
- **Synchronous Processing**: User interactions are processed synchronously.

**Impact**:
- User interactions could block the main thread and affect scheduler timing
- Rapid user interactions could cause multiple state updates
- No way to prioritize timing-critical user interactions

#### Browser Integration

The application integrates with the browser environment:

```javascript
// From audioCore.js
export const ctx = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
```

**Issues**:
- **Browser Variations**: Web Audio API implementation details can vary across browsers.
- **No Feature Detection**: There is limited feature detection or fallback mechanisms.
- **No Background Tab Handling**: There is no specific handling for background tab throttling.

**Impact**:

## Global Issues

### Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the analysis of the Audional Sequencer codebase:

#### 1. Main Thread Overload

The main thread is responsible for too many operations:
- UI rendering and updates
- Event handling
- State management
- Scheduler execution
- Audio node creation and connection
- Sample loading and decoding

This overload can lead to timing issues, as the main thread may be blocked by non-timing-critical operations, affecting the scheduler and audio playback.

**Recommendation**: Offload work from the main thread:
- Move the scheduler to a worker thread
- Use Audio Worklets for complex audio processing
- Implement asynchronous and deferred UI updates
- Prioritize timing-critical operations

#### 2. Fixed Timing Parameters

The codebase uses fixed timing parameters:
- Look-ahead window (0.1s)
- Scheduler interval (0.2s)
- No adaptation to system performance or load

This can lead to suboptimal performance on different devices and under different load conditions.

**Recommendation**: Implement adaptive timing parameters:
- Adjust look-ahead window based on measured performance
- Adapt scheduler interval to system capabilities
- Monitor and respond to performance changes

#### 3. Synchronous State Updates

State updates and notifications are performed synchronously:
- State changes trigger immediate UI updates
- No prioritization of timing-critical updates
- No batching or debouncing of updates

This can lead to main thread blocking and affect scheduler timing.

**Recommendation**: Implement asynchronous state management:
- Defer non-critical UI updates
- Prioritize timing-critical updates
- Batch and debounce updates where appropriate

#### 4. Limited Performance Monitoring

The codebase has limited performance monitoring:
- Some scheduler timing measurements
- Limited logging of timing issues
- No comprehensive metrics or profiling

This makes it difficult to identify and address timing issues.

**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring:
- Measure and log all timing-critical operations
- Implement a performance profiling system
- Provide real-time monitoring of timing performance

#### 5. Resource Inefficiency

The codebase uses resources inefficiently:
- Creates new audio nodes for each step
- No caching or reuse of resources
- Continuous animation and rendering

This can lead to increased CPU usage, garbage collection pauses, and timing issues.

**Recommendation**: Implement resource optimization:
- Pool and reuse audio nodes
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Optimize animation and rendering

### System Gaps

The analysis reveals several system gaps in the Audional Sequencer:

#### 1. No High-Precision Scheduler

The codebase lacks a high-precision scheduler:
- Relies on `setTimeout` for timing
- No compensation for timing inaccuracies
- No fallback mechanisms for timing failures

This is a critical gap for a timing-sensitive application.

**Recommendation**: Implement a high-precision scheduler:
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for more precise timing
- Implement compensation for timing inaccuracies
- Add fallback mechanisms for timing failures

#### 2. No Thread Optimization

The codebase doesn't optimize thread usage:
- Most work is done on the main thread
- No worker threads for background processing
- No Audio Worklets for complex audio processing

This limits the application's ability to achieve professional-grade timing.

**Recommendation**: Implement thread optimization:
- Use worker threads for background processing
- Use Audio Worklets for complex audio processing
- Prioritize main thread for timing-critical operations

#### 3. No Time Source Synchronization

The codebase doesn't synchronize different time sources:
- No synchronization between `AudioContext.currentTime` and `performance.now()`
- No compensation for time source drift
- No validation of time calculations

This can lead to timing inconsistencies over time.

**Recommendation**: Implement time source synchronization:
- Synchronize `AudioContext.currentTime` and `performance.now()`
- Compensate for time source drift
- Validate time calculations

#### 4. No Error Recovery

The codebase has limited error recovery mechanisms:
- No detection or handling of audio buffer underruns
- Limited error handling for audio processing failures
- No recovery mechanisms for timing failures

This can lead to complete playback failure in case of errors.

**Recommendation**: Implement error recovery mechanisms:
- Detect and handle audio buffer underruns
- Enhance error handling for audio processing
- Add recovery mechanisms for timing failures

#### 5. No Adaptation to Platform Variations

The codebase doesn't adapt to platform variations:
- No optimization for different browsers
- No handling of background tab throttling
- No adaptation to different output latency values

This can lead to inconsistent performance across different platforms.

**Recommendation**: Implement platform adaptation:
- Optimize for different browsers
- Handle background tab throttling
- Adapt to different output latency values

## Refactoring Plan

### Architecture Shifts

To achieve professional-grade, sample-accurate timing, several architectural shifts are recommended:

#### 1. Multi-Threaded Architecture

Shift from a single-threaded to a multi-threaded architecture:

**Current Architecture**:
```

│  Rendering  │   Logic     │  Processing │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Proposed Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│ Main Thread │ │Worker Thread│ │Audio Worklet│
├─────────────┤ ├─────────────┤ ├─────────────┤
│     UI      │ │  Scheduler  │ │    Audio    │

    uiUpdates: []
  };
  
  return {
    recordSchedulerExecution: (expectedTime, actualTime, duration) => {
      metrics.scheduler.push({
        expected: expectedTime,
        actual: actualTime,
        duration: duration,
        drift: actualTime - expectedTime,
        timestamp: performance.now()
      });
    },
    
    // ... (similar methods for other metrics)
    
    getMetrics: () => metrics,

      for (const [name, test] of Object.entries(tests)) {
        results[name] = test();
      }
      return results;
    }
  };
})();
```

### Loopbacks

Loopback testing is essential for validating actual audio output timing:

#### 1. Audio Loopback

Connect audio output to input to measure:
- Actual audio output timing
- End-to-end latency
- Timing accuracy and jitter

Implementation:
```javascript
const AudioLoopbackTest = (() => {
  let inputNode = null;
  let analyzerNode = null;
  
  return {
    setup: () => {
      // Request microphone access
      return navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
        .then(stream => {
          // Create input node from microphone
          inputNode = ctx.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
          
          // Create analyzer node
          analyzerNode = ctx.createAnalyser();
          analyzerNode.fftSize = 2048;
          
          // Connect input to analyzer
          inputNode.connect(analyzerNode);
          
          return true;
        });
    },
    
    measure: () => {
      // Generate test tone
      const oscillator = ctx.createOscillator();
      oscillator.frequency.value = 1000;
      oscillator.connect(ctx.destination);
      
      // Record start time
      const startTime = ctx.currentTime;
      oscillator.start(startTime);
      oscillator.stop(startTime + 0.1);
      
      // Measure when the tone is detected in the input
      return new Promise(resolve => {
        const buffer = new Float32Array(analyzerNode.fftSize);
        
        const checkInput = () => {
          analyzerNode.getFloatTimeDomainData(buffer);
          
          // Check if test tone is detected
          const rms = Math.sqrt(buffer.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val * val, 0) / buffer.length);
          
          if (rms > 0.1) {
            // Tone detected
            resolve({
              startTime: startTime,
              detectedTime: ctx.currentTime,
              latency: ctx.currentTime - startTime
            });
          } else {
            // Check again
            requestAnimationFrame(checkInput);
          }
        };
        
        checkInput();
      });
    }
  };
})();
```

#### 2. Visual Loopback

Use a camera to capture visual feedback and measure:
- Synchronization between audio and visual feedback
- Visual feedback latency
- Overall system responsiveness

This requires external hardware and software, but can provide valuable insights into the user experience.

### Logs

Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging timing issues:

#### 1. Timing Logs

- Scheduler execution time and jitter
- Audio event scheduling and actual execution time
- UI update performance
- Overall system latency

Implementation:
```javascript
const TimingLogger = (() => {
  const logs = [];
  const MAX_LOGS = 1000;
  
  return {
    log: (category, data) => {
      logs.push({
        timestamp: performance.now(),
        category,
        data
      });
      
      if (logs.length > MAX_LOGS) {
        logs.shift();
      }
      
      // Also log to console for real-time debugging
      console.log(`[${category}]`, data);
    },
    
    getLogs: () => logs,
    
    clear: () => {
      logs.length = 0;
    },
    
    export: () => {
      return JSON.stringify(logs);
    }
  };
})();
```

#### 2. Performance Logs

Log performance metrics:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Garbage collection events
- Thread utilization

This requires integration with browser performance APIs and may require browser-specific extensions.

#### 3. Error Logs

Log errors and recovery attempts:
- Timing failures
- Audio processing errors
- Scheduling issues
- Recovery actions

Implementation:
```javascript
const ErrorLogger = (() => {
  const errors = [];
  const MAX_ERRORS = 100;
  
  return {
    logError: (category, error, context) => {
      errors.push({
        timestamp: performance.now(),
        category,
        error: error.message || String(error),
        stack: error.stack,
        context
      });
      
      if (errors.length > MAX_ERRORS) {
        errors.shift();
      }
      
      // Also log to console for real-time debugging
      console.error(`[${category}]`, error, context);
    },
    
    logRecovery: (category, action, result) => {
      errors.push({
        timestamp: performance.now(),
        category,
        recovery: true,
        action,
        result
      });
      
      if (errors.length > MAX_ERRORS) {
        errors.shift();
      }
      
      // Also log to console for real-time debugging
      console.log(`[${category}] Recovery:`, action, result);
    },
    
    getErrors: () => errors,
    
    clear: () => {
      errors.length = 0;
    }
  };
})();
```

### Benchmarks

Benchmarks are essential for measuring and comparing timing performance:

#### 1. Scheduler Benchmark

Measure scheduler performance:
- Scheduler jitter
- Scheduling accuracy
- Scheduler overhead

Implementation:
```javascript
const SchedulerBenchmark = (() => {
  return {
    run: (duration = 10000, interval = 100) => {
      return new Promise(resolve => {
        const results = [];
        let lastTime = performance.now();
        let count = 0;
        
        const tick = () => {
          const now = performance.now();
          const elapsed = now - lastTime;
          
          results.push({
            iteration: count,
            expected: interval,
            actual: elapsed,
            drift: elapsed - interval
          });
          
          lastTime = now;
          count++;
          
          if (now - results[0].timestamp < duration) {
            setTimeout(tick, interval);
          } else {
            resolve(results);
          }
        };
        
        setTimeout(tick, interval);
      });
    },
    
    analyze: (results) => {
      const drifts = results.map(r => r.drift);
      
      return {
        mean: drifts.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / drifts.length,
        min: Math.min(...drifts),
        max: Math.max(...drifts),
        stdDev: Math.sqrt(drifts.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val * val, 0) / drifts.length - Math.pow(drifts.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / drifts.length, 2))
      };
    }
  };
})();
```

#### 2. Audio Timing Benchmark

Implementation:
```javascript
const UIBenchmark = (() => {
  return {
    run: (iterations = 100) => {
      return new Promise(resolve => {
        const results = [];
        
        const runIteration = (i) => {
          if (i >= iterations) {
            resolve(results);
            return;
          }
          
          // Measure UI update performance
          const startTime = performance.now();
          
          // Trigger a state update that will cause UI updates
          State.update({ currentStep: i % 64 });
          
          // Use requestAnimationFrame to measure when the update is rendered
          requestAnimationFrame(() => {
            const endTime = performance.now();
            
            results.push({
              iteration: i,
              duration: endTime - startTime
            });
            
            // Run next iteration
            runIteration(i + 1);
          });
        };
        
        runIteration(0);
      });
    },
    
    analyze: (results) => {
      const durations = results.map(r => r.duration);
      
      return {
        mean: durations.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / durations.length,
        min: Math.min(...durations),
        max: Math.max(...durations),
        stdDev: Math.sqrt(durations.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val * val, 0) / durations.length - Math.pow(durations.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / durations.length, 2))
      };
    }
  };
})();
```

## Risks

The following risks should be considered when implementing the refactoring plan:

### 1. Browser Compatibility

**Risk**: Different browsers have different implementations of the Web Audio API, which could affect timing performance.

**Mitigation**:
- Test on all major browsers

**Mitigation**:
- Understand and work within API limitations
- Implement workarounds where possible
- Set realistic expectations for timing precision

### 4. Refactoring Complexity

**Risk**: The refactoring plan is complex and could introduce new issues.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement changes incrementally
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Maintain comprehensive logging and monitoring

### 5. User Experience Impact

**Risk**: Changes to improve timing could negatively impact other aspects of the user experience.

**Mitigation**:
- Balance timing precision with other user experience factors
- Test with real users
- Provide configuration options for different use cases

## Conclusion

The Audional Sequencer is a promising web-based digital audio workstation with a focus on step sequencing and sample manipulation. However, the current implementation has several timing issues that prevent it from achieving professional-grade, sample-accurate timing.

The audit has identified critical issues in the scheduler, audio processing, UI updates, and thread management. These issues can lead to latency, jitter, and scheduling inaccuracies that affect the user experience.

The proposed refactoring plan addresses these issues with a prioritized approach, focusing on the most critical issues first. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the Audional Sequencer should be able to achieve the target performance of <10ms round-trip latency, <1ms scheduling jitter, and sample-accurate internal timing.

The plan includes architectural shifts, prioritized fixes, best practices, and testing strategies. It also considers potential risks and provides mitigation strategies.

By following this plan, the Audional Sequencer can become a professional-grade audio application that meets the needs of demanding users while maintaining the accessibility and flexibility of a web-based application.
