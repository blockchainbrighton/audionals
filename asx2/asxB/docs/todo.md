# Multi-Sequence Implementation Todo

## Phase 1: Architecture Analysis & Design ✓
- [x] Examine current codebase structure
- [x] Understand state management system
- [x] Analyze current sequence/preset format
- [x] Design multi-sequence architecture

## Phase 2: Multi-Sequence State Management ✓
- [x] Create sequenceManager.js module
- [x] Extend state.js for multi-sequence support
- [x] Implement sequence switching logic
- [x] Add sequence metadata management

## Phase 3: Navigation UI Components ✓
- [x] Design sequence navigation buttons
- [x] Add CSS styles for navigation
- [x] Implement sequence selector UI
- [x] Add sequence naming/renaming functionality

## Phase 4: Save/Load Extensions ✓
- [x] Extend save functionality for multi-sequence projects
- [x] Update load functionality to handle multi-sequence files
- [x] Implement individual sequence export/import
- [x] Add sequence duplication functionality

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing ✓
- [x] Integrate all components
- [x] Test sequence switching
- [x] Test save/load functionality
- [x] Verify UI responsiveness

## Phase 6: Package Delivery ✓
- [x] Prepare updated modules
- [x] Create integration instructions
- [x] Test drop-in compatibility
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Package all deliverables

## Design Decisions:
- Keep current single-sequence state structure intact
- Add sequence manager layer above current state
- Minimal UI changes - add navigation bar above existing controls
- Backward compatibility with existing JSON files
- New multi-sequence format extends current format
