Filename: audioTrimModule.js

Overview:
This file defines the AudioTrimmer class, which encapsulates functionality for trimming an audio sample on a per-channel basis. It provides methods for initializing UI elements (sliders, canvas, buttons), updating slider values, drawing the waveform of the audio buffer, and playing/stopping the trimmed audio. The class interacts with the global settings to retrieve and update trim settings and leverages the Web Audio API for audio processing.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	channelIndex: Identifies the channel for which the trimmer is instantiated.
	•	startSliderValue & endSliderValue: Represent the current positions of the trim sliders, initialized from global settings.
	•	audioContext: A new instance of the Web Audio API’s AudioContext, used for audio playback.
	•	audioBuffer: Stores the loaded audio data for waveform rendering and playback.
	•	isPlaying & isLooping: Flags indicating the playback state and whether the trimmed audio should loop.
	•	DOM Elements: Variables referencing elements such as waveformCanvas, playbackCanvas, trimmerPlayButton, trimmerStopButton, loopButton, startSlider, endSlider, startDimmed, endDimmed, and sliderTrack.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Web Audio API: Utilizes AudioContext, BufferSource, and associated methods for handling audio playback and looping.
	•	Canvas API: Uses canvas elements (waveformCanvas and playbackCanvas) for rendering visual representations of the audio waveform and playback position.
	•	Event Handling and Debouncing: Implements event listeners for user interactions (mouse events on sliders and button clicks) and uses debouncing (with setTimeout) to limit the frequency of UI updates.
	•	Progressive Initialization: Waits for DOM elements to become available before finalizing initialization, ensuring all required UI components are ready.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Dynamic DOM Integration: The initialize() method repeatedly checks for the availability of required elements and initializes them once available.
	•	Slider Interaction: Custom mouse event handling is implemented for the sliders to dynamically update trim values, ensuring that the start slider cannot surpass the end slider and vice versa.
	•	Waveform Rendering: The drawWaveform() method computes min/max values over segments of the audio buffer to draw a representative waveform.
	•	Playback Control: Methods like playTrimmedAudio(), stopAudio(), and toggleLoop() manage audio playback, including looping functionality and animation of the playback cursor via requestAnimationFrame.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	DOM Caching: Cache frequently accessed DOM elements (beyond the initial query in initializeSliderTrack()) to minimize repeated DOM lookups.
	•	Error Handling Consistency: Standardize error messaging and handling, particularly in asynchronous initialization and event callbacks.
	•	Code Modularity: Consider splitting complex methods (such as the slider mouse event handler) into smaller helper functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
	•	Animation Efficiency: Optimize the playback animation loop to ensure minimal impact on performance, possibly by checking for changes before redrawing the canvas.
