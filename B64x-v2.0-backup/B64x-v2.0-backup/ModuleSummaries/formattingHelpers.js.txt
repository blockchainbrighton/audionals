Filename: formattingHelpers.js

Overview:
This file provides utility functions for formatting and validating URLs and IDs related to ordinals content. It ensures that the URLs conform to expected patterns, corrects common mistakes (such as duplicated base URLs), and extracts or constructs full URLs based on a base URL constant.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	BASE_ORDINALS_URL: A constant string that defines the base URL for ordinals content, used as a reference point for formatting and validation.
	•	isValidOrdinalsUrl(url): A function that uses a regular expression to verify if a given URL matches the expected pattern of an ordinals content URL.
	•	formatId(id): A function that validates and formats an ID using a regex pattern, ensuring it meets the required structure.
	•	formatURL(url): A function that converts a potentially relative or malformed URL into a correctly formatted absolute URL, handling cases of duplicated base segments.
	•	toFullUrl(id): A function that prefixes a properly formatted ID with the base URL to create a complete URL.
	•	extractIdFromUrl(url): A function that removes the base URL from a valid ordinals URL to extract just the ID portion.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Regular Expression Validation: Utilizes regular expressions to enforce strict formatting rules for both URLs and IDs, ensuring consistency across the application.
	•	Utility-First Approach: The file is designed as a collection of pure functions that perform discrete tasks related to URL formatting and validation.
	•	Error Logging: Incorporates console error logging to inform developers when an invalid ID or URL is encountered, aiding in debugging and quality control.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Robust URL Correction: The formatURL function addresses multiple edge cases, such as duplicated base URLs and missing base URLs, ensuring that the resulting URL is consistently formatted.
	•	Separation of Concerns: Each function handles a specific aspect of formatting or validation, making the code easy to understand, test, and maintain.
	•	Dependency on a Single Base URL Constant: Centralizing the base URL in a constant (BASE_ORDINALS_URL) simplifies future modifications and reduces the risk of discrepancies across different functions.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Regex Performance: Review the regular expressions for potential performance improvements or simplifications, especially if these functions are called frequently.
	•	Error Handling Consistency: Standardize the error handling strategy (e.g., returning null vs. throwing an error) across all functions to streamline integration with other parts of the codebase.
	•	Module Export: Similar to gzipProcessing.js, consider exporting these functions using ES6 module syntax if the project structure supports modules, which would improve modularity and facilitate unit testing.
	•	Documentation: Adding inline documentation or comments that explain the rationale behind the regex patterns could improve maintainability for future developers.
