- **Virtual Keyboard:** Play notes using mouse or touch; supports polyphony with per-note synth instances.
- **MIDI Input:** Requires device connection and browser permissions.

# A Comprehensive Analysis of Modular FM Synth v2 README Development

## Introduction and Project Overview
The README was developed to serve both end-users and developers, ensuring clarity in usage and contribution. The project leverages **Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis**, where the frequency of a modulator oscillator influences a carrier oscillator. This design enables a diverse range of sounds from bells to leads, making the synthesizer an educational platform for understanding FM synthesis in web-based audio applications.

The README highlights:
- The project's purpose and functionality.
- The user interface and synthesis engine.
- Effects such as delay and reverb.
- The arpeggiator and recording features.

## Methodology for README Creation
The process involved analyzing the project structure and functionality, which is organized as follows:
- `index.html` for the UI.
- `css/style.css` for styling.
- `js` directory containing:
  - `audio.js`
  - `fmSynth.js`
  - `fullControls.js`
  - `keyboard.js`
  - `main.js`
  - `presets.js`
- Subdirectories for:
  - Effects (FX)
  - Arpeggiator (arp)
  - Recorder (recorder)

This modular approach allowed a detailed breakdown of features for the README.

### README Structure:
- **Introduction:** Defining the project and FM synthesis.
- **Getting Started:** Requirements and basic usage instructions.
- **User Guide:** Detailed explanations of UI components.
- **Developer Guide:** Project structure, technologies, and contribution guidelines.
- **Tutorials and Examples:** Step-by-step guides for common tasks.
- **Known Issues and Limitations:** Potential problems and workarounds.
- **Future Developments:** Planned enhancements.

# Detailed User Guide
- **Preset Selection:** Users can choose from pre-defined sound configurations that affect carrier waveform, modulators, and envelope settings.
- **Full Controls:** Fine-tuning options for:
  - **Oscillators:** Carrier and modulators.
  - **Envelope:** ADSR parameters.
  - **LFO:** Adjustable rate, depth, etc.
  - **Global Settings:** Master volume and other settings.
- **Effects:** 
  - **Delay and Reverb:** Toggles and adjustable parameters (time, feedback, mix, decay) enhance sound depth.
- **Arpeggiator:**
  - Sequences armed notes in patterns (up, down, random) with adjustable rates.
  - Tied to master BPM for timing.
- **Recording:** 
  - Supports capturing and playing back note sequences.
  - Features include quantization (snapping to a grid) and looping (repeating over specified bars).
- **Virtual Keyboard:**
  - Styled for 80% viewport width and centered.
  - Allows mouse or touch interaction.
  - Supports polyphony with per-note synth instances.
- **MIDI Input:** Requires device connection and browser permissions.

# Developer Insights
- **Project Structure:** Emphasizes the use of the Web Audio API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with ES6 modules.
- **Synthesis Engine:** Detailed in `fmSynth.js` managing:
  - Carrier and modulator oscillators.
  - ADSR envelopes.
- **Application Orchestration:** `main.js` connects various components:
  - Effects (e.g., `delay.js`, `reverb.js`)
  - Features like arpeggiator (`arpeggiator.js`) and recorder (`recorder.js`).

**Contribution Guidelines:**
- Fork the repository.
- Make changes and test thoroughly.
- Submit pull requests.
- Follow coding standards (ES6 syntax, modular code, comments, camelCase naming).

**Browser Support:**
- Designed for modern browsers supporting ES6 modules.
- Local server setup (e.g., `python -m http.server`) is recommended for features like recording due to browser security restrictions.

# Tutorials and Practical Examples
- **Sound Creation:** 
  - Start by selecting a preset (e.g., "Classic Bell").
  - Adjust the envelope for gradual starts.
  - Add modulators as needed.
- **Using Effects:** 
  - Enable delay and reverb.
  - Adjust mixes to achieve the desired ambiance.
- **Arpeggiation:** 
  - Arm keys.
  - Select desired patterns.
  - Adjust rates accordingly.
- **Recording:** 
  - Arm the recording feature.
  - Play and record sequences.
  - Use quantization for tighter playback.

# Known Issues and Limitations
- **Browser Compatibility:** Potential issues outside of Chrome.
- **Performance:** May degrade on lower-end machines with many active synths.
- **Recording Functionality:** 
  - Security restrictions may affect usage.
  - Local server usage is recommended.
- **Timing Precision:** The use of `setTimeout` for playback scheduling in `recorder.js` may affect timing; future improvements may involve Web Audio API scheduling.

# Future Developments
Planned enhancements include:
- Expanding the preset variety.
- Implementing filter controls for sound shaping.
- Enhancing MIDI support.
- Adding save/load functionality for custom settings and sequences.

# Conclusion
This comprehensive README ensures that **Modular FM Synth v2** is accessible and extensible, supporting both sound creation and development contributions. Detailed insights into its structure and functionality, along with support for polyphony and a range of features, underscore its educational and creative value.
