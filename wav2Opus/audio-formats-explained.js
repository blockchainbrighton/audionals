    conceptsTitle: `<h2>Core Concepts: Lossless vs. Lossy & Bitrate</h2>`, // Property name: string value

    losslessVsLossy: `
        <p><strong>Lossless (e.g., WAV):</strong> Stores audio data without discarding information. Quality is identical to the original source, resulting in the largest file sizes. Ideal for archiving and professional editing.</p>
        <p><strong>Lossy (e.g., MP3, Opus):</strong> Achieves smaller sizes by permanently discarding data deemed less audible to humans (using "psychoacoustic models"). Quality loss is inherent but can be minimal at high settings. Great for streaming and portable devices. <em>Re-encoding lossy files causes further quality loss.</em></p>
    `, // Comma needed after the value

    bitrate: `
        <p><strong>Bitrate (kbps - kilobits per second):</strong> Represents the amount of data used per second of audio. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Higher Bitrate:</strong> Generally = More data, potentially higher quality, larger file size.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Bitrate:</strong> Generally = Less data, more compression artifacts (potential quality loss), smaller file size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Codec efficiency matters!</em> A modern codec like Opus usually sounds better than MP3 at the same bitrate.</p>
        <p><strong>VBR (Variable Bitrate):</strong> Used by Opus and our MP3 setting (-q:a). Allocates more data to complex audio sections and less to simple ones, generally offering better quality for a given average size than CBR (Constant Bitrate).</p>
        <p><strong>File Size Estimation (Approx.):</strong> Size (KB) â‰ˆ (Bitrate (kbps) * Duration (s)) / 8</p>

    wav: `
        <h3>WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lossless (usually uncompressed PCM).</li>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Highest fidelity, identical to the digital source.</li>
            <li><strong>File Size:</strong> Very Large (~10 MB per minute for CD quality).</li>
            <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Perfect quality for editing/archiving.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Impractical size for streaming/portable use.</li>
        </ul>

    mp3: `
        <h3>MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lossy.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Varies with bitrate. 128-192 kbps often acceptable, 256-320 kbps considered high quality. VBR (\`-q:a\` setting here, 0=Best/Largest, 9=Worst/Smallest) is generally better than CBR.</li>
            <li><strong>File Size:</strong> Good reduction (~1 MB/min @ 128 kbps).</li>
            <li><strong>Compression:</strong> Older, less efficient psychoacoustic model than Opus.</li>
            <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Highly compatible.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less efficient than modern codecs, artifacts more noticeable at lower bitrates.</li>
        </ul>

    opus: `
        <h3>Opus</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lossy.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> State-of-the-art efficiency. Superior to MP3 at the same bitrate, especially below 128 kbps. Excellent for both speech and music.</li>
            <li><strong>File Size:</strong> Very flexible, excellent compression.</li>
            <li><strong>Compression:</strong> Modern (SILK+CELT), adaptable bitrate, low latency.</li>
            <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Best quality-to-size ratio, open standard, royalty-free, great for web/VoIP.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less compatible than MP3 on very old hardware (support is widespread now).</li>

    opusRecommendationsTitle: `<h2>Opus Bitrate Recommendations (Quality vs. Size)</h2>`, // Comma needed

    opusDetails: `
        <p>Opus is versatile. The "ideal" bitrate depends on your needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>~128 kbps+:</strong> Often achieves <strong>perceptual transparency</strong> (indistinguishable from WAV for most listeners). Technically still lossy, so use WAV/FLAC for true archival. 128-160 kbps is usually sufficient; higher rates offer diminishing returns.</li>
            <li><strong>~96 kbps:</strong> A common "sweet spot" for high-quality stereo music streaming. Excellent quality, significant size savings.</li>
            <li><strong>~64 kbps:</strong> Surprisingly good stereo music quality (often better than MP3 @ 128kbps). Great for mobile/web. Very good for high-quality stereo speech.</li>
            <li><strong>~48 kbps:</strong> Excellent for mono speech (podcasts). Usable for less critical stereo/background music.</li>
            <li><strong>~32 kbps:</strong> Primarily for speech intelligibility (VoIP). Music noticeably compressed.</li>
            <li><strong>Below 32 kbps:</strong> Highly compressed speech for very low bandwidth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> For near-WAV quality, try <strong>96-128 kbps</strong>. For excellent web/mobile music, <strong>64-96 kbps</strong> is great. For high-quality speech, <strong>48-64 kbps</strong> is usually plenty.</p>
        <p><em>Consider: Source complexity, listening environment, listener sensitivity, and bandwidth/storage limits. Always test!</em></p>
