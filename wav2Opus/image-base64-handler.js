<summary>File Summary: image-base64-handler.js (DEPRECATED)</summary>

**Purpose:** Previously provided utility functions for image to Base64 conversion and download link generation.

**Status:** DEPRECATED / REMOVED.

**Reason:** Functionality is fully covered and better integrated within `image-to-base64.js`. Keeping this file would be redundant. Callers should use `image-to-base64.js` instead.
