The Pitch slider works beautifully. So smooth. 
What would be good is to allow pitch to be possible in both directions so it goes up to 1000% or down to -1000x (playing 1000% in reverse) 
We need to update the pitch slider so it sits in the middle at 100% and can be moved positively to speed up forwards or down to 1% still forwards but very slow then hits 0 and stops then -1 veryt slow reverse and so on.
