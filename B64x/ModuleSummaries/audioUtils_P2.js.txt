Filename: audioUtils_P2.js

Overview:
This file constitutes Part 2 of the audio utilities module, focusing on the playback and control aspects of audio processing. It provides functions to play sounds based on channel and step data, manage offline audio buffers, control playback parameters such as speed and trim values, and update UI elements like mute buttons and play state indicators. The module leverages shared state from Part 1 and integrates with the overall project through global settings.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	audioBuffers: A reference to the shared Map of audio buffers from Part 1, used to retrieve buffers for playback.
	•	activeAudioSources: A reference to the shared Set that tracks active audio sources, ensuring proper lifecycle management during playback.
	•	log: A logging function inherited from Part 1 for consistent debug output.
	•	Key Functions:
	•	playSound: Initiates sound playback for a given channel and step, handling both forward and reverse playback modes.
	•	createOfflineAudioBuffer: Renders an offline audio buffer at a specified playback rate for processing or preview purposes.
	•	stopAllAudio: Stops all currently active audio sources, ensuring a clean state.
	•	calculateTrimValues: Determines the start point and duration for audio playback based on channel-specific trim settings.
	•	getChannelIndex: Parses a channel index from a channel element’s dataset.
	•	getAudioUrl: Retrieves the audio URL for a specific channel from the global settings.
	•	getAudioBuffer: Fetches an audio buffer from the shared state using a URL key.
	•	togglePlayState: Toggles the play state of UI elements and initiates corresponding audio actions.
	•	updateMuteState / toggleMute: Manage the mute state of channels, updating both the UI and underlying audio gain settings.
	•	getIframeIdByChannelIndex: Retrieves an iframe identifier via the helper from Part 1.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Web Audio API: Utilizes the Web Audio API extensively for creating, controlling, and processing audio sources, gain nodes, and playback parameters.
	•	BroadcastChannel API: Uses BroadcastChannel for inter-iframe communication, coordinating audio playback actions such as starting or stopping arpeggiators.
	•	Asynchronous Processing: Implements asynchronous functions for tasks like offline audio buffer rendering.
	•	Modular Design: Encapsulated within an IIFE to expose its API via window.AudioUtilsPart2, ensuring separation of concerns and encapsulation.
	•	Event-Driven UI Integration: Directly interacts with DOM elements and updates UI states (e.g., mute buttons, play state toggles) based on audio playback status.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Dynamic Source Node Creation: Always creates a new source node for each playback request to ensure independent playback instances and avoid conflicts.
	•	Inter-Iframe Coordination: Uses the BroadcastChannel API to synchronize actions (like starting/stopping an arpeggiator) across different parts of the UI possibly running in separate iframes.
	•	Trim Value Calculation: Provides detailed logic for calculating precise playback start times and durations, accommodating both forward and reverse playback.
	•	Detailed Logging: Contains comprehensive logging statements throughout the playback process for effective debugging and performance tracing.
	•	UI State Management: Integrates audio controls with UI elements by updating classes and dataset properties to reflect current playback and mute states.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Centralized Logging: Refactor repeated logging into a centralized logging utility to streamline output and reduce redundancy.
	•	Error Handling: Enhance and unify error handling across functions, particularly in asynchronous operations and UI interactions, to improve robustness.
	•	BroadcastChannel Cleanup: Ensure robust cleanup of BroadcastChannel instances to prevent resource leaks and improve performance.
	•	Code Reuse: Abstract common logic (e.g., audio node creation and configuration) into reusable functions to minimize code duplication and enhance maintainability.
