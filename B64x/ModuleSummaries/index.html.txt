Overview:
This file serves as the main entry point and UI layout for the Audional Sequencer web application. It constructs the interface for a drum-machine-like sequencer, incorporating controls for playback (play/stop), BPM adjustment, sequence navigation, and utility functions (save, load, copy, paste). The file integrates various modals and templates for channels and instructions, supporting interactive audio sample management and manipulation.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	drum-machine-container: The primary container that houses the entire sequencer interface.
	•	play & stop: IDs for the play and stop buttons that control sequence playback.
	•	nice-slider & bpm-display: Elements used for adjusting and displaying the Beats Per Minute (BPM) setting.
	•	project-name: Input field for entering the project name.
	•	Utility Elements: IDs like save-button, new-load-button, copy-sequence-settings, paste-button, and instruction-button that provide various functionalities for managing sequences.
	•	Tooltip Elements: Numerous elements with the tooltip class that provide inline instructions for user actions.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	CSS Styling: Utilizes multiple external CSS files (e.g., global-structural.css, components.css, popups-modals.css) for consistent styling and layout, promoting a modular design approach.
	•	JavaScript Modular Architecture: Loads a series of external JS files (some as ES6 modules) that handle discrete aspects of functionality, such as audio trimming (audioTrimModule_v2.js), global settings (masterSettings.js), pattern handling (stepHandling.js), and more.
	•	Responsive Design: Implements a viewport meta tag to ensure proper scaling and responsiveness on various devices.
	•	Component-Based UI: Employs hidden templates (e.g., channel templates) and modals to dynamically generate and manage UI components, following a reusable and maintainable component pattern.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Tooltips and Interactive Guidance: Extensive use of tooltips on buttons and inputs to guide users through the interface.
	•	Channel Template: A hidden channel template designed for dynamic instantiation of channel controls, including buttons for volume, playback speed, muting, soloing, and audio trimming.
	•	Multiple Modals: Incorporates several modal dialogs (e.g., help modal, audio trimmer modal) that are triggered by specific actions, indicating a focus on user assistance and interactivity.
	•	Script Organization: A clear separation of concerns is visible by splitting functionality across many JS files, suggesting an architecture that favors modularity and maintainability.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Asset Consolidation: Consider bundling and minifying CSS and JS files to reduce HTTP requests and improve page load performance.
	•	Redundancy Review: Evaluate whether some functionalities implemented across multiple scripts can be consolidated to simplify maintenance.
	•	Semantic HTML Enhancements: Replace some generic <div> elements with more semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate to improve accessibility and code readability.
	•	Event Handling Efficiency: Review the initialization and handling of tooltips and modal interactions to ensure that event listeners are optimally managed, possibly reducing duplication.
