Filename: volumeSettings.js

Overview:
This script enables users to adjust the volume and playback speed for each channel in the Unified Sequencer. It achieves this by displaying modal dialogs with sliders and numeric input fields that allow real-time control of audio parameters. The file plays a key role in enhancing user interaction, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments of channel-specific settings, and updating both the UI and the underlying global state.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	modalTimeout & mouseOutTimeout: Timeout identifiers used to automatically close the modal after a period of inactivity or on mouseout events.
	•	DOM Element Collections:
	•	volumeButtons: A NodeList of elements with the class .volume-button that trigger the volume modal.
	•	speedButtons: A NodeList of elements with the class .playback-speed-button that trigger the playback speed modal.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Vanilla JavaScript & DOM Manipulation: Utilizes native event listeners (e.g., addEventListener) and DOM APIs to create, show, and hide modal elements dynamically.
	•	Event-Driven Architecture: Listens for DOMContentLoaded, click, mouseover, and mouseout events to trigger modals and reset inactivity timers.
	•	Modular UI Components: Implements helper functions (createCloseButton, createSlider, createTextInput) to generate consistent UI components (e.g., sliders, text inputs) used in modals.
	•	State Synchronization: Interacts with the global sequencer state (window.unifiedSequencerSettings) to get and set channel values for volume and playback speed.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Dynamic Modal Positioning: The modal is positioned relative to the triggering button (using its offset values) to ensure it appears contextually near the control.
	•	Inactivity Timeout Management: Implements both a longer (20-second) and a shorter (10-second on mouseout) timeout to automatically close modals, preventing clutter and unintentional lingering of UI elements.
	•	Two-Way Data Binding: The slider’s input event updates the adjacent numeric text input, and vice versa, ensuring consistency in displayed values and underlying state updates.
	•	Global State Updates: Changes made via the modal directly update the corresponding properties in window.unifiedSequencerSettings, including persisting volume settings in localStorage.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	DRY Principle: Consolidate similar code segments in the createSlider and createTextInput functions for volume and speed to reduce redundancy.
	•	DOM Caching: Cache repeated DOM queries (e.g., repeatedly querying the same modal element) to improve performance.
	•	Error Handling: Add error handling for scenarios where the global state (e.g., gain nodes) might be undefined or not properly initialized.
	•	Accessibility Enhancements: Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for modal components.
	•	Styling Separation: Move inline styles to CSS classes to enhance maintainability and facilitate theme changes or responsive design improvements.
