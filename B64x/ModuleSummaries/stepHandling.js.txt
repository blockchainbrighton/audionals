Filename: stepHandling.js

Overview:
This file manages the logic for processing and rendering individual sequence steps during playback. It handles actions such as toggling mute states on channels, updating the visual playhead on step buttons, and managing transitions between steps and sequences. It interacts with global state (via window.unifiedSequencerSettings) and preset data to synchronize UI and audio playback behavior.

Key Variables/Constants:
	•	totalNumberOfSequences: Captures the number of sequences as defined in the global settings.
	•	currentStep, totalStepCount (global variables assumed): Used to track the current step index and total steps played.
	•	Functions:
	•	handleStep(channel, channelData, totalStepCount): Determines if a step toggles mute based on channel data and updates the channel’s mute state accordingly.
	•	renderPlayhead(buttons, currentStep): Updates the visual indicators on step buttons to reflect the current playback position.
	•	playStep(): Iterates through channels to process each step, play corresponding audio, and handle sequence transitions if needed.
	•	incrementStepCounters(): Increments counters for current step, beats, and bars, and emits beat/bar events at regular intervals.
	•	handleSequenceTransition(targetSequence, startStep): Manages the transition to a new sequence by updating the global current sequence, resetting counters, and refreshing UI elements.
	•	resetCountersForNewSequence(startStep): Resets various step counters (current step, beat, bar, total step count) when a new sequence begins.

Frameworks and Methodologies:
	•	Vanilla JavaScript: Implements core logic using plain JavaScript and standard DOM manipulation.
	•	Procedural Programming: Uses sequential function calls and global state variables to manage the flow of playback and sequence transitions.
	•	Event-Driven Updates: Triggers UI updates (e.g., playhead rendering) and state changes (mute toggling, step incrementation) based on user interactions and scheduled events.

Noteworthy Implementation Details:
	•	Integration with Global State: Functions frequently access window.unifiedSequencerSettings for current sequence settings and updating the UI, ensuring consistency across modules.
	•	Mute Toggling via Step Data: The handleStep function toggles a channel’s mute state based on whether the current step is flagged as a toggle mute step, directly affecting audio output.
	•	Synchronized Counters: The incrementStepCounters function carefully updates various counters (steps, beats, bars, sequences) to maintain accurate timing and synchronization during playback.
	•	Sequence Transition Management: The handleSequenceTransition function not only updates the current sequence but also refreshes the UI and resets counters, ensuring a smooth transition between sequences.

Potential Optimizations:
	•	Modularization: Extracting state counter management (step, beat, bar) into its own module could simplify testing and maintenance.
	•	Error Handling: Introduce additional error checks or fallback logic for potential undefined global variables (e.g., currentStep) to prevent runtime errors.
	•	Reduce Console Logging: Remove or conditionally enable extensive debug logging for production builds to improve performance and reduce noise.
	•	Improved Abstraction: Abstract common patterns (e.g., UI update logic for steps) into reusable helper functions to minimize code repetition.
