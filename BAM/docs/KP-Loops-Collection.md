**KP Loops – Recursive Music Ordinal Collection**
*by Kieron Pepper × Bitcoin Audional Matrix (BAM)*

---

### 1. The Genesis Drop

KP Loops is **the first-ever library of on-chain audio samples** released through the Bitcoin Audional Matrix—BAM’s open, decentralised framework for Web3 music production. Each of the **88 high-fidelity percussion loops** is permanently inscribed as a Bitcoin Ordinal, forming the bedrock on which future BAM instruments, plug-ins and full-length tracks will be built. ([audionals.com][1], [audionals.com][2])

### 2. Why **88**?

A concert-grand piano spans 88 notes. By matching that number, KP Loops lets creators **map one loop to every key** of a MIDI controller or keyboard, unlocking instant, performance-ready beat construction. The “88 standard” sets the template for all forthcoming BAM libraries, ensuring seamless interoperability across the entire ecosystem.

### 3. About the Artist

**Kieron Pepper** is a multi-instrumentalist, producer and educator best known as:

* the **original live drummer for The Prodigy (1997-2007)**
* a current member of the **BBC Radiophonic Workshop**
* a collaborator with artists ranging from Sleeper to Wargasm UK. ([waterbear.org.uk][3], [1883magazine.com][4])

His three-decade legacy of pushing sonic boundaries now arrives, unfiltered, on the world’s most secure ledger.

### 4. About Bitcoin Audional Matrix

BAM is a next-generation protocol that stores **high-resolution Opus-encoded audio, modular synth definitions and BVST plug-ins directly on Bitcoin**. Musicians, developers and fans co-create an on-chain digital audio workstation where ownership, royalties and version control are trustlessly enforced by the blockchain itself.

### 5. What’s Inside KP Loops

| Category                 | Feel & Use-Case (examples)                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Breakbeats**           | Classic 90 – 120 BPM breaks for jungle, hip-hop, D\&B |
| **Cinematic Hits**       | Thunderous impacts for trailers & game audio          |
| **Electronica Grooves**  | 4-bar loops for techno, house, IDM                    |

All loops are mastered at 48 kHz, 24-bit, compressed to Opus for on-chain efficiency, and distributed under an **open Web3 licence** that guarantees remix freedom while preserving provable origin.
