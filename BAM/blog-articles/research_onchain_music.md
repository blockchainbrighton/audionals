**Source 2: Splits.org - "Onchain Music 101" (https://splits.org/blog/onchain-music-101/)**
- Quote: "Once a song is minted onchain — it will exist there forever. This means that a song has a permanent lineage."
- Platforms for minting music:
    - Sound.xyz: Biggest NFT platform for music. Two-tier model (Free Editions - no audio, like POAP; Limited Edition - includes music). Integrated with Splits for revenue sharing.
    - Coop Records: Onchain record label on Sound.xyz. Custom frontend with token incentives. Offers Free Edition (no audio on Sound.xyz, but downloadable from Coop Records site) and Coop Records Club (subscription for releases and earnings share).
    - Songcamp (Audiato): Custom frontend showcasing music on Zora protocol.
    - Catalog: Upcoming, not open-access yet.
    - Subvert: Aiming to be a collectively owned Bandcamp successor.
    - Audius: Incorporates crypto ($AUDIO token), uses Ethereum, Solana, and an Audius-specific EVM blockchain. Unclear if minting is true NFT minting.
- Listening to onchain music: Platforms where you mint usually allow streaming. Zora (loops single song), Sound.xyz (playlists), Coop Records & Audiato (continuous play). Surreal app (browse audio NFTs).
- Honorable mentions (marketing/mintable video): Drakula, Unlonely. Sonata (Farcaster client for music), Pods (mintable podcasts).

**Source 3: Chainlink - "How Music NFTs Can Reshape the Music Industry" (https://chain.link/education-hub/music-nfts)**
- Music NFT: Distinct digital asset on a blockchain linked to a song, EP, album, or video clip.
- Artists can create NFTs for music, concert tickets, merch, virtual experiences.
- Benefits:
    - Direct artist-fan relationship, circumventing large platforms.
    - Artists maintain full ownership.
    - Revenue/royalty-sharing features independent of traditional streaming models.
    - Helps emerging artists without traditional funding/distribution.
    - Token-gated communities for exclusive events/promotions.
    - Shifts ownership from companies to individuals.
- Economic Impact: Compares low streaming payouts (e.g., $0.004/stream on Spotify) to potentially higher earnings from NFT sales (e.g., 100 NFTs at $40 each = $4000, same as 1 million streams).
- Curation as Investment: Fans can become early investors, supporting artists with potential financial return, changing fan-artist dynamic.
- Fan Communities & Digital Identity: NFTs as cultural signaling, decentralized fan organization.
- Generative music on-chain: Permanent imprint, preserved as intended.
