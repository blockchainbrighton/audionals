# Audionals: On-Chain Music Production and Rights Management

## What are Audionals?

Audionals is a pioneering protocol that transforms music production, distribution, and rights management by offering an on-chain digital audio workstation (DAW) built on the Bitcoin blockchain. By fully operating within a decentralized on-chain environment, Audionals redefines Web3 music.

## Key Features and Benefits

1. **True Web3 Composition**: Each song created with the Audionals protocol is a true Web3 composition, existing solely through programmatic assembly in a single-domain, on-chain environment. The output files, known as Bitcoin Audionals, are immutable recordings that encapsulate the entire creation process.

2. **Revolutionary Rights Management**: Every element involved in a song's creation—such as vocal recordings, keyboard parts, and plugin codes—is owned and held within individual wallets. The song file itself serves as an immutable Merkle tree that references each component's wallet address and rights holder.

3. **Embedded Rights**: Audionals redefines how music is created, owned, and distributed by embedding rights directly into the song's digital structure. This ensures transparency, immutability, and decentralized ownership.

4. **Accessibility for All Musicians**: By making blockchain technology affordable and accessible, Audionals liberates artists from the burden of high file sizes and costs, paving the way for unprecedented creativity and innovation.

5. **Comprehensive Attribution**: The protocol ensures transparent attribution for every component used in creating a song, recognizing not only composers and sample holders but also contributions from those using specific effects and tools.

## Technical Implementation

Audionals appears to offer a sequencer interface (the "Ord SPD") that allows musicians to create music directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The interface includes:

- A step sequencer grid for programming beats and melodies
- BPM control for tempo adjustment
- Sample loading capabilities
- Playback controls
- Save/load functionality for projects

The technology leverages Bitcoin's blockchain to store and execute the music files, creating a fully on-chain music production environment.
