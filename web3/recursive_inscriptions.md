# Recursive Inscriptions for Large Media Files on Bitcoin

## Technical Implementation

Recursive inscriptions solve the problem of Bitcoin's block size limitations for media files like music. The technique allows developers to split large files into smaller parts, inscribe each part separately, and then reassemble them on-chain.

## How It Works

1. **File Splitting**: Large media files (like MP3s) are split into smaller chunks that fit within Bitcoin's inscription size limits.

2. **Individual Inscriptions**: Each chunk is inscribed separately on the Bitcoin blockchain, receiving its own unique inscription ID.

3. **Reassembly Function**: A JavaScript function like `inscriptionJoin` is used to fetch all the individual inscriptions and concatenate their binary data together.

4. **Verification**: Hash digests can be used to verify that the reassembled file matches the original.

## Example Implementation

```javascript
import { inscriptionJoin } from '/content/e2eba066c7c28f8e6c4e4c7b91cfa4cbc8e9e0de8e30c95d47709bb8d81048bci0';  
  
inscriptionJoin([  
  <inscription-id-for-part-1>,  
  <inscription-id-for-part-2>,  
  ...  
  <inscription-id-for-part-n>,  
]).then((byteArray) => {   
  // do something with the complete file   
});
```

## Applications for Music

This technique enables:

- Full music tracks to be stored on-chain
- Interactive music players with synchronized visual elements
- Sheet music that follows along with audio playback
- Complex audio applications that would otherwise exceed Bitcoin's size limitations

By using recursive inscriptions, developers can create rich, interactive music experiences directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without relying on off-chain storage solutions.
