# BOP Synthesizer Integration Todo

## Phase 1: Extract and analyze the synthesizer codebase
- [x] Extract uploaded zip file
- [x] Analyze main app.js entry point
- [x] Examine BopSynth.js main synthesizer class
- [x] Review state management in BopSynthLogic.js
- [x] Understand UI components and event flow
- [x] Identify PianoRoll integration points

## Phase 2: Identify integration points and dependencies
- [x] Map event bus communication patterns
- [x] Identify state synchronization requirements
- [x] Find components that modify sequence data
- [x] Locate note creation/editing interfaces
- [x] Document current PianoRoll instantiation

## Phase 3: Update event bus communication patterns
- [x] Ensure proper event dispatching to PianoRoll
- [x] Update sequence change notifications
- [x] Verify note selection/deselection events
- [x] Check quantization change events

## Phase 4: Modify state management and data flow
- [x] Update state object structure if needed
- [x] Ensure proper sequence data format
- [x] Verify note object properties
- [x] Update any direct DOM manipulations

## Phase 5: Update component initialization and lifecycle
- [x] Update PianoRoll instantiation
- [x] Ensure proper event bus setup
- [x] Verify state object passing
- [x] Test component lifecycle

## Phase 6: Test integration and deliver updated codebase
- [ ] Create test scenario
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Package updated codebase
- [ ] Deliver integrated solution
