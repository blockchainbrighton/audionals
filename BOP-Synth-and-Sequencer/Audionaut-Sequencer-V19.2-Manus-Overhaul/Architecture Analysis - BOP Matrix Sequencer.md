# Architecture Analysis - BOP Matrix Sequencer

## Current Structure Overview

The sequencer is organized as a modular ES6 application with the following key components:

### Core Modules
- `sequencer-main.js` - Entry point and bootstrapping
- `sequencer-config.js` - Configuration constants
- `sequencer-state.js` - State management (project and runtime state)
- `sequencer-ui.js` - User interface rendering and event handling
- `sequencer-audio-time-scheduling.js` - Transport and timing control
- `sequencer-sampler-playback.js` - Sample playback logic
- `sequencer-sample-loader.js` - Sample loading from Ordinals
- `sequencer-instrument.js` - Instrument channel management

## Issues Identified

### 1. Critical Bugs
- **Typo in main.js**: Line with `setLoader-status` should be `setLoaderStatus`
- **Potential race conditions**: Dynamic Tone.js loading without proper error handling

### 2. Performance Issues
- **Memory leaks**: Creating new Player and AmplitudeEnvelope instances on every sample trigger without proper pooling
- **GC pressure**: setTimeout-based disposal creates unnecessary garbage collection pressure
- **No audio worklet usage**: All processing happens on main thread

### 3. Timing and Determinism Issues
- **Floating-point BPM**: Using floating-point values for BPM could lead to drift
- **Non-deterministic scheduling**: Relying on setTimeout for cleanup introduces timing variability
- **Missing lookahead**: No scheduling lookahead buffer for consistent timing

### 4. Security Concerns
- **External URL loading**: Loading Tone.js from external ordinals.com URL without integrity checks
- **No input validation**: Missing validation for user inputs (BPM, sample indices)
- **XSS potential**: Direct DOM manipulation without sanitization

### 5. Modularity Issues
- **Tight coupling**: Modules directly import and modify each other's state
- **No plugin architecture**: No clear extension points for future modules
- **Missing type definitions**: No JSDoc types for better API documentation

### 6. Code Quality Issues
- **Inconsistent error handling**: Some functions have try/catch, others don't
- **Missing tests**: No test suite for critical timing and state logic
- **Unclear APIs**: Function signatures not well documented

## Recommendations for Phase 2+

### Performance Optimizations
1. Implement object pooling for audio nodes
2. Use AudioWorklet for sample playback
3. Add scheduling lookahead buffer
4. Optimize hot paths in step scheduling

### Security Improvements
1. Add integrity checks for external resources
2. Implement input validation and sanitization
3. Add CSP headers and secure loading

### Modularity Enhancements
1. Design plugin architecture with stable APIs
2. Implement dependency injection for better testability
3. Add comprehensive JSDoc type definitions
4. Create clear extension points

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all core functions
2. Integration tests for timing accuracy
3. Performance benchmarks for scheduling jitter
4. Deterministic state tests

## Architecture Strengths
- Clean ES6 module structure
- Separation of concerns between UI and audio logic
- Configurable constants
- Event-driven UI updates
- Modular channel types (sampler vs instrument)
