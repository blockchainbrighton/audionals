# Sequencer Perfection Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze current codebase architecture and identify issues
- [x] Examine main HTML entry point (sequencer.html)
- [x] Analyze core modules structure and dependencies
- [x] Review sequencer-main.js for overall architecture
- [x] Examine audio scheduling and timing implementation
- [x] Identify potential race conditions and timing issues
- [x] Review state management patterns
- [x] Assess current modularity and extension points
- [x] Document current architecture findings

## Phase 2: Security audit and Web3 vulnerability assessment
- [x] Review Web3 interface implementation
- [x] Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- [x] Audit user input handling
- [x] Review script injection prevention
