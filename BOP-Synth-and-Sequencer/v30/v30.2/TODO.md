Review the step button display logic and streamline it so step buttons are always displayed in the expanded view beliw the rest of the channel controls instead of in a condensed view in the same row. 

Consider how to make the channel controls more flexible for the users to display just the step buttons or expand to show both the channel buttons and waveform display as well as the steps below them.
