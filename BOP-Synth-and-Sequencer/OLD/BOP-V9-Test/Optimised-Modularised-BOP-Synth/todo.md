# BOP Synthesizer Refactoring Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze existing codebase structure and dependencies
- [x] Examine HTML structure and identify UI components
- [x] Analyze app.js and synth-module.js for global state management
- [x] Map dependencies between modules
- [x] Identify global variables and DOM access patterns
- [x] Document current architecture and data flow

## Phase 2: Create the main BopSynthComponent class with event system
- [x] Create BopSynthComponent.js with ES6 class structure
- [x] Implement constructor with targetElement and Tone parameters
- [x] Move HTML template from BOP-V8.html into component
- [x] Implement event emitter system (on/emit methods)
- [x] Set up internal state management

## Phase 3: Refactor core modules (keyboard, controls, effects, recorder)
- [x] Refactor keyboard.js to class-based architecture
- [x] Refactor enhanced-controls.js to remove global dependencies
- [x] Refactor enhanced-effects.js with scoped DOM access
- [x] Refactor enhanced-recorder.js with event-based communication

## Phase 4: Refactor UI and utility modules (piano-roll, loop-manager, save-load)
- [x] Refactor piano-roll.js to component architecture
- [x] Refactor loop-manager.js with scoped state management
- [x] Refactor save-load.js to use component state
- [x] Update envelope-manager.js

## Phase 5: Refactor engine and transport modules
- [x] Refactor synth-engine.js to remove global dependencies
- [x] Refactor audio-safety.js with component integration
- [x] Refactor transport.js to use event-based communication

## Phase 6: Create integration and test the refactored component
- [x] Create test HTML file to verify component functionality
- [x] Update BopSynthComponent with complete module integration
- [x] Implement proper event system and state management
- [x] Test all synthesizer features work correctly
- [x] Verify no global state leakage
- [x] Test component instantiation and cleanup

## Phase 7: Deliver the complete refactored codebase to user
- [x] Create comprehensive README documentation
- [x] Create refactoring summary document
- [x] Package all refactored modules
- [x] Verify all files are complete and functional

## Phase 7: Deliver the complete refactored codebase to user
- [ ] Package all refactored files
- [ ] Create usage documentation
- [ ] Provide complete working example
