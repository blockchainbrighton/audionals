Based on the provided code and my analysis, here is an explanation of the game "Card Crawl Quest: The Shadow Crypts":

### Game Overview

"Card Crawl Quest: The Shadow Crypts" is a single-player, dungeon-crawler-style card game. The primary goal is to survive your journey through the Shadow Crypts and escape with as much health and gold as possible. You navigate the crypts by playing cards from your hand, which can be enemies, loot, or events.

### How to Play

The game is turn-based. Each turn, you are presented with a hand of four cards drawn from a shuffled deck. You must play all the cards in your hand to end the turn and draw a new hand. The game ends when either your health drops to zero (you lose) or you have played all the cards in the deck and discard pile (you win).

### The Game Interface

The screen is divided into three main panels:

*   **Left Panel (Inventory & Gear):** This shows your current stats, including Gold, Health (HP), Damage Buff (from Swords), Potions, Shields, Swords, Keys, and Relics.
*   **Center Panel (Game):** This is the main gameplay area. It displays:
    *   **Story Log:** A record of all actions and events that have occurred.
    *   **Stats:** A quick view of your current HP, Gold, and Keys.
    *   **Message:** Provides brief updates on your actions.
    *   **Hand:** Shows the cards you currently have to play.
    *   **End Turn Button:** Allows you to draw a new hand after you've played all cards from your current one.
*   **Right Panel (Quests):** This displays your active side quests, their descriptions, your progress, and their rewards.

### Card Types

There are three types of cards you will encounter:

*   **Enemy Cards:** These cards represent monsters you must fight. When you play an enemy card, you take damage equal to its attack value. Some enemies have additional effects, such as a Vampire that also drains your gold or a Wraith that can steal a key.
*   **Loot Cards:** These cards provide you with beneficial items and resources. You can find Gold, Potions to restore health, Shields to block damage, Swords to increase your attack, Keys to open treasure rooms, and Relics to complete quests.
*   **Event Cards:** These cards trigger specific events that can be either helpful or harmful. You might encounter a trap that deals damage, a blessing that heals you, a curse that drains health and gold, a merchant who will trade health for gold, or a treasure room that requires a key to grant a large amount of gold.

### Player Stats

You have several key statistics to manage:

*   **HP (Health Points):** Your life force. If it reaches zero, you die, and the game is over. You start with 20 HP.
*   **Gold:** Used for certain events and as a measure of your success at the end of the game.
*   **Keys:** Needed to open Treasure Rooms.
*   **Swords:** Increase your damage output against enemies.
*   **Shields:** Block a certain amount of damage from enemy attacks.
*   **Potions:** Can be used to restore your health.
*   **Relics:** Collectible items that can help you complete quests.

### Quests

To add another layer to the game, there are side quests you can complete for rewards. The initial quests are:

*   **Goblin Slayer:** Defeat 3 Goblins to earn 5 gold.
*   **Treasure Hunter:** Collect 5 Relics to earn 2 keys.
*   **Key Master:** Use 3 Keys to earn 10 gold.

Completing these quests will provide you with valuable resources to aid in your survival.

### Winning and Losing

*   **You Win:** if you successfully play through the entire deck and discard pile. Your victory is measured by your remaining health and accumulated gold.
*   **You Lose:** if your HP drops to 0 at any point. You will be told how much gold you managed to collect before you perished.

Good luck in the Shadow Crypts
