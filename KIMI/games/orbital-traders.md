# Orbital Traders

Welcome, space merchant! Orbital Traders is a 2D sandbox game where you pilot a spaceship in a star system governed by real-time orbital mechanics. Your goal is to earn credits by trading goods between planets, fulfilling contracts, and upgrading your ship.

## Objective

The primary goal is to accumulate as many **credits** as possible. You can do this by:

*   **Trading:** Buying goods at a low price on one planet and selling them for a higher price on another.
*   **Fulfilling Contracts:** Acquiring a specific quantity of a certain good to earn a large credit reward.

The game is a sandbox, so you are free to set your own goals. See how wealthy you can become!

## How to Play

### The Interface (UI)

Your vital information is always displayed in the top-left corner of the screen:

*   **Credits:** Your current amount of money. Used to buy goods, fuel, and ship upgrades.
*   **Fuel:** Your ship's fuel level, starting at 100%. Fuel is consumed every time you use your thrusters.
*   **Contract:** Displays your current contract, if you have one. It shows the amount and type of good required, and the credit reward.
*   **Cargo:** Shows the items currently in your cargo hold.

### Movement and Navigation

Movement in Orbital Traders is based on physics. Your ship is constantly being pulled by the gravity of nearby planets.

1.  **Set Trajectory:** To move, **click and hold** the mouse button anywhere on the screen. While holding, **drag the mouse** to aim your thrust. A projected flight path will appear, showing you where your ship will go based on your current aim and the gravitational pull of the planets.
2.  **Engage Thrusters:** **Release the mouse button** to fire your thrusters. This applies a burst of velocity in the direction you aimed.
3.  **Fuel Consumption:** Firing your thrusters consumes fuel. The longer you drag the mouse from your starting point, the more powerful the thrust and the more fuel you will use.

**Tip:** Use short, calculated bursts of thrust. Let the planets' gravity do most of the work for you to conserve fuel!

### Landing on a Planet

To land on a planet, simply navigate your ship close to it. When you get within its immediate gravitational field, your ship will automatically land, and your velocity will be set to zero.

Upon landing, the **Shop** menu will appear.

### The Shop

When you are landed on a planet, you can interact with the local market and upgrade your ship.

#### Market
Each planet has a market for 8 different types of goods (Good 0 to Good 7).
*   **Buy:** Purchase one unit of a good at the planet's current price. This will take up a slot in your cargo bay.
*   **Sell:** Sell a good from your cargo bay at the planet's current price.

The prices are dynamic. Buying a good on a planet will slightly increase its price, while selling will slightly decrease it. The key to trading is to find a planet where a good is cheap and another where it is expensive.

#### Ship Services
*   **Buy Fuel (10c):** Purchase 20 units of fuel for 10 credits.
*   **Upgrade Cargo Bay (100c):** Increase your maximum cargo capacity by 2 slots.
*   **Upgrade Thruster (200c):** Makes your thrusters more powerful and efficient, giving you more velocity for the same amount of fuel.

To leave the shop and the planet, simply perform a thrust maneuver (click, drag, and release).

### Contracts

Occasionally, you will be offered a contract, which will appear in your UI. A contract requires you to have a certain amount of a specific good in your cargo hold.

To complete the contract, simply buy or acquire the required goods. Once the condition is met, the goods will be automatically removed from your cargo, and the reward will be added to your credits. You do not need to deliver the goods to a specific location.

### Saving Progress

Your game is **saved automatically** in your browser's local storage every few seconds. You can close the tab and your progress (credits, ship status, location) will be there when you return.
