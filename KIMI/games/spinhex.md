# SpinHex

## Overview
SpinHex is a captivating puzzle game that challenges your ability to spot patterns and plan ahead. The game is played on a hexagonal grid with a central tile and three surrounding rings. By rotating the rings, you'll align colored tiles to create matches, clear the board, and rack up a high score. Chain reactions are key to mastering the game!

## Objective
The goal of SpinHex is to score as many points as possible by matching three or more tiles of the same color. Your performance is tracked by your score and the number of moves you've made. Aim to beat your personal best score, which is saved in your browser.

## How to Play

### The Game Board
The board consists of 37 hexagonal tiles arranged in a central tile and three concentric rings:
*   **Center:** A single, stationary tile.
*   **Ring 1 (Inner):** Contains 6 tiles.
*   **Ring 2 (Middle):** Contains 12 tiles.
*   **Ring 3 (Outer):** Contains 18 tiles.

Each game starts with a pre-set, random arrangement of colored tiles.

### Making a Move
*   To play, simply **click on any of the three movable rings**.
*   Clicking a ring will cause it to **rotate one position clockwise**.
*   Each rotation counts as a single **move**.
*   The central tile cannot be rotated.

### Scoring
Points are awarded for creating matches of three or more identically colored tiles. Matches can be formed in two ways:
1.  **Ring Matches:** Aligning three or more tiles of the same color consecutively **around a single ring**.
2.  **Spoke Matches:** Aligning three or four tiles of the same color in a straight line **radially from the center outwards**.

For each tile that is part of a match, you will receive **10 points**.

### Cascades and Chain Reactions
*   When a match is made, the matched tiles disappear from the board.
*   Tiles from the inner rings will then "fall" outwards to fill the empty spaces.
*   The empty spaces created at the center of the board are filled with new, randomly colored tiles.
*   This "cascade" can cause new matches to form automatically, creating a **chain reaction** that can lead to massive scores without using any extra moves.

## UI Elements
At the bottom of the game canvas, you will find the following information:
*   **Score:** Your current score for the game session.
*   **Moves:** The total number of rotations you have made in the current session.
*   **Best:** Your highest score achieved across all play sessions. This score is saved automatically.

Now you're ready to play. Good luck, and have fun spinning!
