# Hexabloom-2 Game Guide

Hexabloom-2 is an engaging puzzle game where the objective is to clear a board of colored hexagons by finding and eliminating matching groups. The game is designed to be a daily challenge, with a new puzzle generated each day.

## How to Play

The gameplay is simple and intuitive, making it easy to learn but challenging to master.

**Objective:**
The primary goal is to clear the entire hexagonal grid of all colored tiles to achieve the highest possible score.

**Gameplay Steps:**

1.  **Start the Game:** When the game loads, you will see a grid filled with hexagons of various colors.
2.  **Select a Group:** Click on any colored hexagon on the board. This action selects the chosen hexagon along with all adjacent hexagons of the same color, forming a connected group.
3.  **Clear the Tiles:** Once selected, the entire group of matching hexagons will disappear from the board.
4.  **Continue Playing:** Keep selecting groups of same-colored hexagons to clear them from the grid. The goal is to clear every single tile.

## Scoring

*   **Earning Points:** Your score is equal to the total number of individual hexagons you have cleared from the board.
*   **Chain Bonus:** You get more points for a single move by clearing a larger chain of connected hexagons.
*   **Best Score:** The game keeps track of your highest score across all your sessions. This "Best" score is displayed at the top right of the screen and is saved in your browser.

## Winning the Game

You win the game when you have successfully cleared every single hexagon from the board. Upon completion, a "Completed!" message will appear, displaying your final score for that round.

## Daily Challenge & Sharing

Hexabloom-2 features a daily puzzle system.

*   **Daily Seed:** The arrangement of the colored hexagons is generated based on the current date. This means that everyone plays the exact same puzzle on any given day.
*   **Share Your Puzzle:** After completing a board, the game will provide you with a "Shareable seed" (which is the date). You can share this seed with friends, allowing them to play the same puzzle you just solved and compare scores.
