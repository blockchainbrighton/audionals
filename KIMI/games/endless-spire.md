# Endless Spire â€¢ Draft of Fate - How to Play

Welcome, adventurer, to the Endless Spire! This guide will walk you through the basics of the game, helping you understand the interface, core mechanics, and strategies needed to survive the ever-deepening shadows.

## Objective

The goal of **Endless Spire** is to survive as many waves of enemies as possible while accumulating the highest score. The game is a turn-based deck-builder. You will use a deck of cards to attack enemies and defend yourself, adding new cards and upgrading existing ones as you progress deeper into the spire.

## The Game Screen

The screen is divided into a few key areas:

*   **Header (Top):** Displays your current vital statistics.
    *   **Wave:** The current wave number you are fighting.
    *   **Score:** Your total score, which increases by clearing waves and completing quests.
    *   **HP:** Your Health Points. If this reaches 0, your run is over.
    *   **Block:** Temporary armor that absorbs enemy damage for the current turn. It resets to 0 at the start of the enemy's turn.
    *   **Gold:** A resource gained by clearing waves. *Note: Gold currently contributes to your final standing but has no in-game shop or use.*

*   **Battle Area (Left):** This is where the action happens.
    *   **Enemy Area (Top):** Shows the enemies you are currently facing, their HP, and their intended attack power (ATK).
    *   **Hand Area (Bottom):** Displays the cards you can play during your turn.
    *   **End Turn Button:** Click this when you are finished playing cards for your turn.

## Core Gameplay

The game proceeds in turns. First is your turn, then the enemy's turn.

### 1. Your Turn

At the start of your turn, you draw 5 cards from your deck into your hand.

*   **Playing Cards:** To play a card, simply click on it in your hand. The card's effect will be triggered immediately. *Note: Although cards display a "cost", this mechanic is not yet implemented; you can play any card from your hand for free.*
*   **Targeting:** All single-target attacks will automatically hit the first enemy in the line (the leftmost one).
*   **Ending Your Turn:** Once you have played all the cards you wish to, click the **"End Turn"** button to proceed to the enemy's turn.

### 2. Enemy Turn

After you end your turn:
1.  Your **Block** is reset to 0.
2.  Enemies affected by **Poison** will take damage.
3.  Each enemy will attack you for their listed ATK value.
4.  The game then automatically draws a new hand of 5 cards for you, and your next turn begins.

## Cards & Deckbuilding

Your deck is your primary tool for survival.

### Anatomy of a Card
*   **Name:** The card's title.
*   **Description:** Explains what the card does.
*   **Cost:** The intended energy cost to play the card (currently not functional).

### Your Starting Deck
You begin your journey with a small deck consisting of:
*   **3x Strike:** Deals 6 damage.
*   **2x Defend:** Grants 5 Block.

### Between Waves: Drafting & Upgrading

After successfully clearing a wave of enemies, you will be given an opportunity to improve your deck.

*   **Card Draft:** After most waves, you will be presented with a choice of 3 random cards. Click one to add it permanently to your deck.
*   **Card Upgrade:** Every 3 waves, you will be shown the cards in your deck and given the chance to upgrade one. An upgraded card has a significantly improved effect. For example:
    *   **Strike** (6 damage) becomes **Strike+** (9 damage).
    *   **Defend** (5 block) becomes **Defend+** (8 block).

### Reshuffling
When your draw pile is empty, your discard pile is automatically shuffled to become your new draw pile.

## Status Effects

*   **Poison:** A debuff you can apply to enemies. An enemy with Poison takes damage equal to its Poison value at the start of their turn, and the Poison value then decreases by 1.

## Quests

The side area displays quests that you can complete for bonus score. Keep an eye on these objectives to maximize your points!

## Winning and Losing

*   **Losing the Game:** Your run ends if either of these conditions is met:
    1.  Your **HP** is reduced to 0 or less.
    2.  You run out of cards in your hand, draw pile, and discard pile, leaving you unable to act.

*   **Winning the Game:** The Spire is "Endless." The true goal is to survive for as long as you can and achieve the highest possible score before your inevitable defeat. Good luck!
