# Monster Merge Arena: Chronicles of Aetheria

## Game Overview

Welcome, Summoner, to the mystical realm of Aetheria! In **Monster Merge Arena: Chronicles of Aetheria**, you are chosen by the ancient Aether Crystals to restore balance to a fractured world. Your journey begins with a small team of basic elemental spirits. By merging these spirits, you will unlock new, powerful creatures and discover the secrets of forgotten elements. Battle through progressively challenging realms, watch the story unfold, and guide Aetheria back to harmony.

## How to Play

### The Main Goal

Your primary objective is to restore the **Aether Balance**, which is tracked by the progress bar at the top of the screen. You increase the balance by winning battles and advancing through the realms. The ultimate goal is to reach 100% balance, uncovering all elemental powers along the way.

### Merging Your Spirits

Merging is the core mechanic for creating stronger allies.

1.  **Select Your Spirits**: In the "Your Elemental Spirits" panel, click on any two spirits you wish to combine.
2.  **Automatic Merge**: Once you select a second spirit, they will automatically merge into a single, new creature.
    *   The two original spirits are consumed in the process.
    *   The new spirit's level will be the sum of the two spirits used to create it (e.g., a Level 2 and a Level 3 spirit merge into a Level 5).
3.  **Merge Results**:
    *   **Same Elements**: Merging two spirits of the same element (e.g., Fire + Fire) creates a higher-level spirit of that same element.
    *   **Different Elements**: Merging two different elements can result in a new, hybrid elemental type. Experiment with combinations to discover them all!
4.  **Rare Spirits**: There is a small chance that any merge will result in a **Rare** spirit. These spirits have a gold border and possess significantly higher stats than their normal counterparts.

### Elemental Types

You begin with four basic elements. As you progress, you will unlock four more powerful ones through merging and story progression.

*   **Starting Elements**:
    *   üî• **Fire**: High attack, low health.
    *   üíß **Water**: Balanced attack and health.
    *   üåø **Grass**: Can heal itself during battle.
    *   ü™® **Rock**: Very high health, low attack.
*   **Unlockable Elements**:
    *   ‚ö° **Storm**: Unlocked around Realm 5.
    *   ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Ice**: Unlocked around Realm 10.
    *   ‚ú® **Light**: Unlocked around Realm 15.
    *   üåë **Dark**: Unlocked around Realm 15.

### Entering the Arena

1.  **Prepare for Battle**: The battle will always be fought by the **first spirit shown on the left** in your team panel. Arrange your spirits so your strongest is in that lead position before starting a fight.
2.  **Start the Fight**: Click the **"Journey to Realm X"** button to challenge the current realm's guardian.
3.  **Automatic Combat**: The battle unfolds automatically. A brief animation will play, and the results will be printed in the log panel at the bottom, detailing the attacks, damage, and outcome.
4.  **Victory**: If you win:
    *   The Realm number increases.
    *   Your Aether Balance goes up.
    *   You are rewarded with a new, random, low-level spirit.
5.  **Defeat**: If you lose, your spirits retreat to recover. All of your spirits will have their health restored, and you can try the realm again. You do not lose any progress.

### Rest and Recover

Every 5 realms you conquer, a new button will appear: **"Rest at Aether Spring"**. Clicking this button will:
*   Fully heal all of your current spirits.
*   Give each spirit a chance to gain a level, making them even stronger.

Use this opportunity to empower your team before you continue your journey! Good luck, Summoner
