## 🚀 Game Overview

Welcome, Summoner, to the mystical realm of Aetheria! In **Monster Merge Arena: Chronicles of Aetheria**, you have been chosen by the ancient Aether Crystals to restore balance to a fractured world. Your journey begins with a small team of basic elemental spirits. By merging these spirits, you will unlock new, powerful creatures, discover the secrets of forgotten elements, and battle through progressively challenging realms. Watch the story unfold and guide Aetheria back to harmony!

## 🎯 The Main Goal

Your primary objective is to restore the **Aether Balance**, which is tracked by the progress bar at the top of the screen. You increase the balance by winning battles and advancing through the realms. The ultimate goal is to reach 100% balance, uncovering all elemental powers and saving Aetheria.

## 🔬 Core Mechanics

### Merging Your Spirits

Merging is the central mechanic for creating stronger allies.

1.  **Select Your Spirits**: In the "Your Elemental Spirits" panel, click on any two spirits you wish to combine.
2.  **Automatic Merge**: Once a second spirit is selected, they will automatically merge into a single, more powerful creature. The two original spirits are consumed in the process.
3.  **Leveling Up**: The new spirit's level will be the sum of the two spirits used to create it (e.g., a Level 2 and a Level 3 spirit merge into a Level 5).
4.  **Rare Spirits**: There is a 10% chance that any merge will result in a **Rare** spirit. These spirits have a distinctive gold border and possess significantly higher stats than their normal counterparts, making them invaluable in tough battles.

### Elemental Merge Combinations

*   **Same Elements**: Merging two spirits of the same element (e.g., 🔥Fire + 🔥Fire) creates a higher-level spirit of that same element.
*   **Different Elements**: Merging two different base elements can result in a new, hybrid elemental type. Experiment with combinations to discover them all!

Here are the specific recipes for creating advanced elemental types:

| Combination | Resulting Element |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- |
| 🔥 Fire + 💧 Water | ⚡ Storm |
| 🔥 Fire + 🌿 Grass | ⚡ Storm |
| 💧 Water + 🪨 Rock | ❄️ Ice |
| 🌿 Grass + 🪨 Rock | ❄️ Ice |
| 🔥 Fire + ❄️ Ice | ✨ Light |
| 💧 Water + ⚡ Storm | ✨ Light |
| 🌿 Grass + ⚡ Storm | 🌑 Dark |
| 🪨 Rock + ❄️ Ice | 🌑 Dark |

### Elemental Types & Abilities

You begin with four basic elements. As you progress, you will unlock four more powerful ones through strategic merging. Each element has unique characteristics.

| Element | Icon | Type | Special Ability / Characteristic | Unlock Realm |
| :-------- | :--: | :------- | :------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| **Fire** | 🔥 | Basic | High Attack, Low Health | Start |
| **Water** | 💧 | Basic | Balanced Attack and Health | Start |
| **Grass** | 🌿 | Basic | Can heal itself during battle | Start |
| **Rock** | 🪨 | Basic | Very High Health, Low Attack | Start |
| **Storm** | ⚡ | Advanced | Deals area-of-effect damage (hits multiple foes) | Around Realm 5 |
| **Ice** | ❄️ | Advanced | Can freeze opponents, causing them to miss a turn | Around Realm 10 |
| **Light** | ✨ | Advanced | Possesses strong defensive and healing capabilities | Around Realm 15 |
| **Dark** | 🌑 | Advanced | Can drain life from opponents | Around Realm 15 |

## ⚔️ Entering the Arena

1.  **Prepare for Battle**: The battle will always be fought by the **first spirit shown on the left** in your team panel. Always arrange your spirits so your strongest is in that lead position.
2.  **Start the Fight**: Click the **"Journey to Realm X"** button to challenge the current realm's guardian.
3.  **Automatic Combat**: The battle unfolds automatically. A brief animation will play, and the results will be detailed in the log panel at the bottom, showing attacks, damage, and the outcome.
4.  **Victory**: If you win, you will be rewarded!
    *   The Realm number increases.
    *   Your Aether Balance goes up.
    *   You receive a new, random, low-level spirit to add to your team.
5.  **Defeat**: If you lose, there is no penalty. Your spirits retreat to recover, their health is fully restored, and you can try the realm again without losing any progress.

## ✨ Rest and Recover

Every 5 realms you conquer, a button will appear: **"Rest at Aether Spring"**. Clicking this button is a crucial part of your strategy:
*   It fully heals all of your current spirits.
*   It gives each spirit a chance to gain a level, making them stronger for the challenges ahead.

## 💡 Strategy & Tips

*   **Lead with Your Best**: Since only your first spirit fights, always place your highest-level or most advantageous elemental type in the first slot before starting a battle.
*   **Merge for Power**: Continuously merge weaker spirits to build high-level champions. A single high-level spirit is often more effective than many low-level ones.
*   **Focus on Unlocking**: Prioritize making the merge combinations needed to unlock new elements. The advanced elements have powerful abilities that are key to winning in later realms.
*   **Don't Fear Defeat**: Losing a battle has no penalty. Use losses as an opportunity to understand the enemy's strength and rethink your spirit lineup or merge strategy.
*   **Time Your Rests**: Use the "Rest at Aether Spring" feature strategically. If you are close to the 5-realm mark, it might be worth pushing through to get the heal and level-up bonuses for your entire team.
*   **Cultivate Rares**: Pay close attention to your Rare spirits. Their enhanced stats make them prime candidates for your lead battle slot. Protect them and continue to level them up.

Good luck on your quest, Summoner! Aetheria is counting on you.
