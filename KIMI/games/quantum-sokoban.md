# Quantum Sokoban

## Game Objective

Quantum Sokoban is a puzzle game that blends the classic Sokoban rules with quantum superposition.  
Push every crate onto a goal (yellow tile).  
The twist: a pushed crate **splits** into every possible reachable square until you **collapse** it back to a single spot.

## How to Play

1. **Push** ‚Äì Arrow keys, swipe, or tap-to-move.  
   Crates become *ghost* squares when they enter superposition (semi-transparent cyan).
2. **Observe** ‚Äì Press **Space**, the üëÅ button, or click the eye icon.  
   Every crate randomly collapses to one of its possible positions.  
   If two crates land on the same square the level restarts (paradox).
3. **Undo** ‚Äì Press **Z** or the ‚Ü∂ button to rewind your last action.
4. **Restart** ‚Äì Press **R** at any time.

## Touch Controls

* **Swipe** in any direction to move.  
* **Tap** an empty square to move toward it step-by-step.  
* **Tap a crate or goal** for an instant hint.  
* On-screen buttons provide the same actions as the keyboard.

## Winning

All crates must be in their **definite** (solid) state and resting on goal tiles.  
When you win, the next procedurally-generated level loads automatically.
