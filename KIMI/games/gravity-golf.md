# Gravity Golf

## Description

Gravity Golf is a simple yet captivating 2D physics-based game set in a minimalist space environment. The objective is to get your ball into the goal, a designated rectangular area, in as few strokes as possible. The game features celestial bodies, represented as planets, that exert gravitational forces on the ball, influencing its trajectory. Each level is procedurally generated based on the current date, offering a new challenge every day.

## How to Play

The controls are straightforward and entirely mouse-based, making it easy to learn but challenging to master.

### Objective

The primary goal is to guide the ball into the glowing rectangular goal located on the right side of the screen. You aim to do this in the fewest possible strokes. The game keeps track of your current number of strokes and your best score for the day's level. The par for each level is set at 3, providing a benchmark for a good score.

### Controls

*   **Aiming:** To aim your shot, click and hold the left mouse button on the ball.
*   **Power:** While holding the mouse button, drag the cursor away from the ball. A line will appear, indicating the direction and power of your shot. The longer the line, the more powerful your shot will be.
*   **Shooting:** Release the mouse button to launch the ball in the opposite direction of the line you've drawn.
*   **Reset:** A "Reset" button is available in the top-left corner of the screen to restart the level at any time.

### Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Gravity:** The core mechanic of the game is gravity. The planets on the screen have their own mass and will pull the ball towards them. You must use these gravitational forces to your advantage to navigate the level and reach the goal.
*   **Walls:** The game area is enclosed by walls. If the ball hits a wall, it will bounce off with a slight loss of momentum.
*   **Scoring:** Your score is determined by the number of strokes you take. The game displays your current stroke count and your best score for the current level. If you complete a level with a score lower than your previous best, your new best score will be saved.

Good luck, and may the gravitational forces be with you
