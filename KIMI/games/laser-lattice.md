# Laser Lattice

## Overview

Laser Lattice is a puzzle game where your objective is to strategically place various optical components on a grid to guide a laser beam and illuminate all the target "X"s. Success is a matter of logic and spatial reasoning.

## How to Play

The goal of Laser Lattice is to direct the laser beam to hit all of the targets on the grid. The game is won when all targets are simultaneously lit.

### The Grid

The game is played on a 12x12 grid. The laser originates from the top-left corner (0,0) and initially travels to the right.

### Placing and Removing Components

You can select different components from the palette on the right side of the screen. Click on a component in the palette to select it, and then click on an empty square in the grid to place it.

To remove a component from the grid, you can either select the "Clear" tool from the palette and click on the component, or you can right-click on the component you wish to remove.

### Components

There are three types of components you can place on the grid:

*   **Mirror /**: This mirror reflects the laser at a 90-degree angle. For example, a laser traveling horizontally will be reflected vertically, and vice versa.
*   **Mirror \\**: This mirror also reflects the laser at a 90-degree angle, but in the opposite direction of the other mirror.
*   **Splitter |**: This component splits the laser beam. When a laser beam hits a splitter, the original beam passes through it, and a new beam is created that is deflected at a 90-degree angle.

### Targets

The targets are marked with a green "X" on the grid. To win the game, the laser beam must pass through all of these targets.

## User Interface

To the right of the game grid, you will find the user interface which includes:

*   **Palette**: This is where you can select the different components to place on the grid. The currently selected component will be highlighted.
*   **Reset Button**: This button will clear the grid and generate a new puzzle.
*   **Undo/Redo Buttons**: These buttons allow you to step backward and forward through your moves.
*   **Moves**: This counter displays the number of moves you have made in the current puzzle.
*   **Time**: This timer shows how long you have been working on the current puzzle.

## Tips for Success

*   **Plan your path**: Before placing any components, try to visualize the path the laser will need to take to hit all the targets.
*   **Use splitters wisely**: Splitters can be very powerful for hitting multiple targets with a single laser beam.
*   **Don't be afraid to experiment**: If you're stuck, try placing components in different locations to see how it affects the laser's path. You can always use the undo button if you make a mistake.
