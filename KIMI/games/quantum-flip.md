# Quantum Flip

## Description

Quantum Flip is a 2D platformer game where you control a character with the ability to rewind time and create shadow versions of yourself. The objective is to navigate through a procedurally generated level and reach the green exit tile. Each time you succeed, a new level is generated with an increased difficulty. The game tracks your time, encouraging you to complete the levels as quickly as possible.

## How to Play

### Controls

*   **A**: Move Left
*   **D**: Move Right
*   **W**: Jump
*   **R**: Rewind Time

### Gameplay

The goal of each level is to guide your character from the starting position to the green exit tile. You will need to run and jump to navigate the platforms and avoid falling off the level.

The standout feature of this game is the ability to manipulate time. Pressing the 'R' key will rewind your character's position and create a "shadow" of your previous path. This shadow is a recording of your movements for the last few seconds. You can create up to five of these shadows at a time. This mechanic can be used to your advantage in several ways, such as creating platforms out of your past selves to reach new areas.

### User Interface

*   **Seed:** This input field allows you to play a specific level by entering its corresponding seed number. If you find a level you particularly enjoy, you can replay it by entering its seed.
*   **Restart:** This button will restart the current level.
*   **Time:** This displays your elapsed time in the current level.

### Winning the Game

To win a level, you must reach the green exit tile. Upon doing so, the game will automatically generate a new, more challenging level for you to tackle. The seed number will also increment, allowing you to revisit the level later if you wish.
