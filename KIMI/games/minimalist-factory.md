# Minimalist Factory – Quick-Start Guide

**Goal:** Produce 50 units of output by building and linking machines on the 6×6 grid.

## How to Play (3-minute tour)

1. **Place machines**  
   - Click any machine button (Generator, Conveyor, Assembler, Seller) – the grid turns grey to show “placement mode”.  
   - Click an empty square to drop the machine.  
   - Hover over a button for a quick description.

2. **Connect machines**  
   - First, click the machine you want to send items **from** (a blue outline appears).  
   - Then click an **adjacent** machine (up/down/left/right) to create a one-way link. An arrow shows the direction.  
   - A machine can only send items in one direction.

3. **Watch the magic**  
   - Generators make raw items.  
   - Conveyors move them.  
   - Assemblers upgrade 2 items → 3 advanced items.  
   - Sellers convert items into your score (Output).  
   - The game ticks every 0.4 s.

## First-time?  
A short on-screen tutorial will guide you through the first three actions. You can dismiss it at any time with the **OK** button.

## Controls
- **Reset** – clears the grid and starts over.  
- Tool-tips – hover any button for a quick hint.

## Tips
- Chain multiple Assemblers for higher value items.  
- Use Conveyors to reach distant Sellers.  
- Plan your layout early—space is limited!

Reach Output ≥ 50 to win. Good luck!
