- [x] Define core game mechanics (e.g., character abilities, level objectives)
- [x] Outline how musical elements will influence gameplay
- [x] Sketch out a high-level architecture for the game (e.g., frontend/backend, audio engine)
- [x] Define the scope of the initial prototype



- [x] Research Web Audio API capabilities for sound synthesis and manipulation.
- [x] Investigate methods for generating specific frequencies and harmonic series.
- [x] Explore techniques for real-time audio processing (e.g., pitch shifting, tempo changes).
- [x] Look into examples or libraries that handle musical scales, chords, and intervals.



- [x] Set up the basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript structure for the game.

- [x] Create a simple level layout with start and end points.
- [x] Implement basic game loop (update, render).
- [x] Add basic player interaction (clicking to select Harmonoids).


- [x] Implement Web Audio API context and basic oscillator nodes.
- [x] Create audio manager class to handle multiple harmonoid sounds.
- [x] Generate harmonic frequencies for each harmonoid based on their base frequency.
- [x] Implement real-time audio synthesis that responds to harmonoid positions and states.
- [x] Add audio feedback for game events (spawning, selection, gate interactions).


- [x] Enhance harmonic gate mechanics to require more complex chord progressions.
- [x] Implement resonance fields that affect harmonoid behavior based on frequency.
- [x] Add dissonance detection that creates hazards or obstacles.
- [x] Create musical puzzles that require specific harmonic combinations.
- [ ] Implement dynamic background music that changes based on harmonoid harmony/dissonance.


- [x] Enhance visual design with better graphics and animations.
- [x] Create additional levels with increasing complexity.
- [x] Add particle effects for musical interactions.
- [x] Improve UI design with better styling and layout.
- [x] Add visual indicators for harmonoid frequencies and effects.


- [ ] Test all game mechanics thoroughly (movement, selection, pitch/tempo changes).
- [ ] Test audio functionality (harmonoid sounds, gate sounds, selection feedback).
- [ ] Test musical elements (resonance fields, dissonance zones, harmonic gates).
- [ ] Verify cross-browser compatibility and performance.
- [ ] Deploy the game to a public URL for sharing.
