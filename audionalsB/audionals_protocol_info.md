# Audionals Protocol Research

## Core Features and Functionality

Audionals is a pioneering protocol that transforms music production, distribution, and rights management by offering an on-chain digital audio workstation (DAW) built on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol operates within a decentralized on-chain environment, redefining Web3 music creation, collaboration, and ownership.

Key features include:

1. **On-chain Digital Audio Workstation**: A decentralized music production environment built directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

2. **Immutable Recording System**: Each song created with the Audionals protocol exists solely through programmatic assembly in a single-domain, on-chain environment. The output files, known as Bitcoin Audionals, are immutable recordings that encapsulate the entire creation process.

3. **Blockchain-based Rights Management**: Every element involved in a song's creation (vocal recordings, keyboard parts, plugin codes) is owned and held within individual wallets. The song file itself serves as an immutable Merkle tree that references each component's wallet address and rights holder.

4. **Elimination of Traditional Intermediaries**: The protocol removes the need for contractual agreements and legal intermediaries, as the song file inherently represents all associated rights.

5. **Embedded Rights Structure**: Audionals redefines how music is created, owned, and distributed by embedding rights directly into the song's digital structure, ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralized ownership.

6. **Affordable Blockchain Technology**: The protocol makes blockchain technology accessible to all musicians, liberating artists from high file sizes and costs.

7. **Comprehensive Attribution**: By integrating all elements of music production into the blockchain, the protocol ensures transparent attribution for every component used in creating a song, recognizing not only composers and sample holders but also contributions from those using specific effects and tools.

## Technology Stack

- Built on the Bitcoin blockchain
- Utilizes the Ordinals protocol (implied by the "Ord SPD" reference)
- Features an on-chain sequencer for music production
- Implements a JSON standard for data representation

## Use Cases and Applications

- Music production directly on the blockchain
- Rights management and ownership verification
- Transparent attribution of all creative contributions
- Decentralized music distribution
- Creation of immutable musical recordings

## Unique Selling Points

1. **True Web3 Composition**: Songs exist solely through programmatic assembly in a single-domain, on-chain environment.
2. **Wallet-based Rights Management**: Every element is owned and held within individual wallets.
3. **Immutable Merkle Tree Structure**: Song files serve as immutable references to each component's wallet address and rights holder.
4. **Elimination of Intermediaries**: No need for traditional contractual agreements and legal intermediaries.
5. **Transparent Attribution**: Comprehensive recognition for all contributors to a musical piece.
6. **Affordable Blockchain Access**: Makes blockchain technology accessible to all musicians.
7. **Potential to Transform Music Industry Economics**: Could fundamentally change how artists are supported financially.
