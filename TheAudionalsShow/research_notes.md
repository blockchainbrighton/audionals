*   **Gated:**
    *   **Description:** A platform on Stacks related to music NFTs, potentially offering `.wav` files and song art for albums.

*   **Audionals & Proof of Transfer (PoX):**
    *   **PoX Explained:** Proof of Transfer (PoX) is the consensus mechanism used by the Stacks blockchain (Bitcoin Layer 2). It leverages Bitcoin's security (Proof of Work) by requiring miners to transfer Bitcoin (BTC) to participate in leader elections for new Stacks blocks. In return, miners are rewarded in Stacks (STX) tokens, and STX holders who participate in consensus ("Stacking") can earn BTC rewards.
    *   **Audionals Connection:** While Audionals itself is a protocol for inscribing music onto Bitcoin (often via Ordinals), its ecosystem and creator (Jim.BTC) have strong ties to the Stacks layer (e.g., founding This is #1, using Gamma's Stacks marketplace). Projects and assets within the Stacks ecosystem, including potentially those related to or inspired by Audionals, benefit from the security provided by Stacks' PoX consensus mechanism, which is anchored in Bitcoin.
