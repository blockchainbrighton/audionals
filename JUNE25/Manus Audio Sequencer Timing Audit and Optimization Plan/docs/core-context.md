# Core Context: Web Audio Sequencer Timing Audit

## Overall Goal:
Achieve robust and perceptually perfect timing for the Audional Sequencer, addressing latency, jitter, and scheduling inaccuracies.

## Current Understanding:
- The application loads audio samples and uses `playbackEngine.js` to schedule them.
- Initial user-provided logs showed scheduler lateness, but also potential for improvement.
- **Extensive internal documentation (`Refactoring Plan`, `Timing Audit Report`) details known issues, analysis, and a comprehensive, prioritized refactoring plan. This audit leverages this existing knowledge.**

## Phase 1: Core Audio Setup & Initialization - Completed Review

### Files Reviewed:
- `js/audioCore.js` (Updated version provided by user)
- `js/audioEngine.js`
- `js/app.js`

### Status & Findings (Summary):
- `AudioContext` is initialized with `latencyHint` and diagnostics. State changes (`onstatechange`) are monitored. (User Implemented Plan Items 2.4, 4.3).
- `audioEngine.js` acts as a facade.
- `app.js` correctly orchestrates setup and uses `playbackEngine.start()` (which includes `ctx.resume()`) for play initiation.

## Phase 2: Playback Engine & Scheduler Logic - Completed Review

### File Reviewed:
- `js/playbackEngine.js`

### Status & Findings (Summary):
- Scheduler uses `requestAnimationFrame`. (Plan Item 1.1 Implemented).
- Adaptive look-ahead logic present. (Plan Item 1.2 Implemented). **Action Point: User to review constants in `adjustLookAhead`.**
- **Audio Node Pooling (Plan Item 2.1) is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.** New audio graph created per note â€“ key optimization area.
- Core scheduling uses `AudioContext.currentTime` correctly.
- Good debugging logs for step timing. (Plan Item 1.4 Partially Addressed).
- **Web Worker for Scheduler (Plan Item 2.3) is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.**

### Recommendations for `js/playbackEngine.js`:
1.  Critically Review `adjustLookAhead` Logic.
2.  Prioritize Implementing Audio Node Pooling (Plan Item 2.1).
3.  Consider Worker Thread for Scheduler (Plan Item 2.3) if main thread contention persists.

## Phase 3: Audio Engine Primitives (Sound Generation & Utilities) - Completed Review

### Files Reviewed:
- `js/utils.js`
- `js/fileTypeHandler.js`

### Status & Findings (Summary):
- `loadSample` in `utils.js` is fully asynchronous.
- `fileTypeHandler.js` is `async` but contains internal synchronous operations (base64 decoding, JSON search) that could slow UI responsiveness *during sample loading*, but not directly impact scheduler precision *during playback*.

## Phase 4: State Management & UI Impact on Timing - In Progress

### Files Reviewed:
- `js/state.js`
- `js/ui.js`
- `js/channelUI.js`
- `js/waveformDisplay.js`

### Status & Findings for `js/state.js`:
*(Carried over from previous review)*
- Implements a functional publish-subscribe pattern.
- **`emit()` calls all listeners SYNCHRONOUSLY.**
- **Refactoring Plan Item 2.2 (Deferred UI Updates via `UIUpdateQueue`) is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.** This is key to decouple state updates in critical paths (like the scheduler) from potentially slow UI rendering.

### Status & Findings for `js/ui.js`:
*(Carried over from previous review)*
- **`State.subscribe(render)` creates a synchronous link between state changes and the main `render` function.**
- The cost of `render` depends heavily on `updateChannelUI` (from `channelUI.js`).
- `animateTransport` runs in a separate `rAF` loop for playheads. Its performance (UI frame rate during playback) depends on `renderWaveformToCanvas` (from `waveformDisplay.js`) because `animateTransport` triggers state changes (`currentPlayheadPosition`) that lead to `ui.js#render`, which in turn calls `channelUI.js#updateChannelUI`. For the waveform playhead to update, `updateChannelUI` must use its `isFullUpdate=true` path (or a similar mechanism) to invoke `renderWaveformToCanvas`.
- **Refactoring Plan Item 2.2 (Deferred UI Updates) is highly relevant to `render`.**
- **Refactoring Plan Item 3.2 (Optimized Canvas Rendering) is relevant to `animateTransport` (via `renderWaveformToCanvas`) and other UI updates involving waveforms.**

### Status & Findings for `js/channelUI.js`:
*(Carried over from previous review, with minor clarifications)*
- **Responsibilities:** Manages individual channel UI elements, event wiring, and calls `renderWaveformToCanvas` for display.
- **Key Observations & Performance Implications:**
    - Event handling for trim handles, auditioning, and zoom changes directly or indirectly (via `State` update -> `ui.js#render` -> `updateChannelUI(isFullUpdate=true)`) calls `renderWaveformToCanvas`. Responsiveness of these interactions is tied to `renderWaveformToCanvas` performance.
    - `updateChannelUI`'s `isFullUpdate` flag is important. The `isFullUpdate=false` path (used for step sequencer playhead updates) is fast and *does not* call `renderWaveformToCanvas`.
    - However, any state change that requires updating the waveform appearance (e.g., trim, fades, sample change, or the main transport playhead via `animateTransport`'s state updates) will lead to `renderWaveformToCanvas` being called, likely through the `isFullUpdate=true` path of `updateChannelUI`.
- **Conclusion for `js/channelUI.js`:** The file itself is well-structured. Performance hinges on the synchronous `State -> UI render` pipeline and the cost of `renderWaveformToCanvas`.

### Status & Findings for `js/waveformDisplay.js`:
- **Functionality:** Renders audio waveforms, trim regions (shaded or zoomed), fade-in/out cues, and playheads to a 2D canvas. Called by `channelUI.js` (for full updates, auditions, zoom) and is essential for `ui.js#animateTransport` to display the main transport playhead on waveforms.
- **Drawing Process:**
    - Handles DPR, clears/resizes canvas, retrieves audio data.
    - Uses a `stepSize` to sample audio data for the canvas width, finding min/max values per vertical slice.
    - Draws waveform path, trim shades, fade gradients, and playhead lines.
    - `zoomTrim` option correctly focuses rendering.
- **Performance Considerations:**
    - **Synchronous Execution:** Blocks the main thread during execution. Its duration directly impacts UI responsiveness and animation smoothness.
    - **Data Iteration:** Iterates over the relevant portion of `audioData`. Cost increases with buffer length and canvas width.
    - **Frequent Calls:**
        - User interactions (trimming, auditioning, zoom) trigger re-renders. Rapid dragging of trim handles can cause many calls.
        - **Crucially, `ui.js#animateTransport` (during playback) updates `currentPlayheadPosition` in the state via `rAF`. This state change triggers `ui.js#render`, which calls `channelUI.js#updateChannelUI`. For the waveform's playhead to move, `updateChannelUI` effectively needs to use a path that calls `renderWaveformToCanvas` for each visible channel on each animation frame.** This makes `renderWaveformToCanvas` performance paramount for smooth playback animation.
- **Relevance to Refactoring Plan Item 3.2 (Optimized Canvas Rendering):**
    - This function is the primary target for these optimizations.
    - **Potential Optimizations (currently not implemented):**
        *   **Caching/Offscreen Canvas:** Render static parts (waveform itself for a given trim) to an offscreen canvas. Overlay dynamic elements (playheads, fades if interactive). Highly beneficial if buffer/trim is static while playheads move.
        *   **Debouncing/Throttling:** For calls from rapid user input (e.g., trim handle dragging), ensure rendering isn't on *every* event.
        *   **Optimized Data Sampling/Drawing:** Further review if min/max calculation or drawing routines can be faster (e.g., using integer coordinates after scaling, minimizing context state changes).
- **Impact on Overall Timing:**
    *   Slow `renderWaveformToCanvas` execution:
        1.  Makes UI interactions (trimming, auditioning, sample loading/display) feel sluggish.
        2.  Critically impacts `ui.js#animateTransport`'s ability to maintain a smooth frame rate during playback, as it's called repeatedly for each visible channel. This can lead to janky visual feedback even if audio timing is perfect.
        3.  If called within the synchronous `State -> UI render` chain due to other state changes, it can block the main thread, potentially delaying other critical operations.

### Pending Items for Phase 4:
- Review `js/uiHelpers.js` (to understand `auditionSample` and other helpers).
- Implementation of Refactoring Plan Item 2.2 (Deferred UI Updates).
- **Active consideration and implementation of Refactoring Plan Item 3.2 (Optimized Canvas Rendering for `js/waveformDisplay.js`).**
