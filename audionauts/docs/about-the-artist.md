## Two Decades in Music Production

Jim Crane – known by the monikers **Jim.BTC** (alias **jimdotbtc** on social media) and formerly by his music alias **Melophonic** – is a British music producer and innovator with over 20 years in the music industry. Based in Brighton, UK, he honed his craft as a producer and songwriter, contributing to diverse projects and bands. Notably, Crane was half of the Brighton-based ukulele duo *Hundred Little Reasons* and part of the electronic group *Let The Machines Do The Work*, showcasing his versatility from acoustic songwriting to dance music production. This extensive background in music **production** and live performance laid the groundwork for Crane’s later innovations at the intersection of music and technology. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, under the **Melophonic** alias, he built a reputation for sonic craftsmanship – experiences that would eventually inspire his foray into blockchain-based music creativity.

## From Bitcoin ATM to NFT Pioneer

Crane’s curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit led him into the world of cryptocurrency early. In 2014, he made headlines by importing **the UK’s first two-way Bitcoin ATM**, a bold move that marked his entry into the crypto space. This pioneering encounter with Bitcoin ignited his interest in blockchain technology and its potential beyond finance. As he later recounted, *“I was technically minded but had no idea about finance... Once I got into crypto, I started learning about code, and that learning formed into what it is now.”* Driven by a problem-solver’s mindset, Crane soon began exploring how blockchain could revolutionise creative industries.

By early 2021, Jim Crane co-founded **This Is #1**, the world’s first curated Bitcoin NFT marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain (a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts). With Crane as a driving force, *This Is #1* launched a groundbreaking inaugural NFT collection – the first **commercial audio-visual NFT series** on Bitcoin via Stacks. This genesis collection featured one-of-one collaborative pieces with internationally acclaimed artists: supermodel/actress **Cara Delevingne**, Grammy-winning DJ **Fatboy Slim**, electronic music legends **Orbital**, and songwriter **Dave Stewart** of Eurythmics fame. One notable piece, *“Mine”* by Cara Delevingne in collaboration with Chemical X, became the first ever NFT minted and auctioned via Stacks (anchored to Bitcoin) in July 2021. Each of these NFTs combined stunning visual art by the anonymous artist Chemical X with original audio or narration from the celebrity collaborators, exemplifying the fusion of music and art on the blockchain.

Following this success, Crane and his team continued to break new ground in 2021 with **music-oriented NFTs**. They commissioned **No.1 Smileys**, a limited-edition series of 1000 audio-visual NFTs created by Fatboy Slim and Chemical X exclusively for Stacks. Debuting in August 2021, *No.1 Smileys* became the first-ever **music NFT collection** on the Stacks blockchain. Each Smiley token featured original beats and iconic smiley-themed artwork, marking the first time legendary producer Fatboy Slim released music as an NFT. To engage the growing community, many of these were given away to early Stacks adopters, blending fan loyalty with blockchain innovation.

Not stopping there, Jim Crane spearheaded another milestone project on Stacks: the **Hash Ones** collection. Launched as *This Is #1*’s next chapter, **Hash Ones** was the first **algorithmically generated (generative) art NFT collection** on Stacks. Initially planned as 111 pieces, 91 unique Hash One artworks were ultimately minted in late 2021, each sold for just 1 STX (Stacks’ token) to demonstrate the platform’s marketplace functionality. Created in collaboration with Chemical X, these NFTs were procedurally generated, showcasing the creative possibilities of code-based art on Bitcoin’s ecosystem. The experiment paid off – what began as a modest test (91 STX total sale) evolved into a valued collection on the secondary market, cementing *Hash Ones* as a historic first in Bitcoin-powered generative art. Through *This Is #1* and its early collections, Jim Crane established himself as a **pioneer of Bitcoin NFTs**, proving that Bitcoin’s security and permanence could be harnessed for creative expression and digital collectibles.

## Audionals: On-Chain Music Innovation

In 2023, riding on the momentum of his Stacks NFT ventures, Jim Crane (now widely known as **Jim.BTC**) turned his focus fully toward Bitcoin itself – specifically the emerging **Ordinals** protocol which enables content to be inscribed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Motivated by a vision to fix the “broken” music industry model (especially issues around royalties and artist rights), he conceived the **Audionals** protocol. Audionals is a revolutionary suite of tools and standards for **on-chain music production** and distribution. In simple terms, it allows musicians and developers to **inscribe audio files and music data directly onto Bitcoin** in a permanent, decentralised manner. Crane essentially merged his tech savvy with his music background to create a new paradigm: songs, samples, and even instruments can be stored as Bitcoin-native digital assets, where ownership and content are one and the same on-chain entity. This approach promises artists greater control and new creative freedom — leveraging Bitcoin’s security to ensure music cannot be altered, censored, or misattributed once recorded to the blockchain, with authorship, rights, and attribution made permanently visible, verifiable, and immutable by the very structure of the ledger itself.**.

Under Jim.BTC’s leadership, Audionals achieved a string of firsts in on-chain audio. In mid-2023, Crane released *“TRUTH,”* the **first-ever recursive music NFT collection on Bitcoin**. Using Audionals’ custom sequencer, he encoded a musical composition entirely in Bitcoin inscriptions, with recursive techniques that reference and re-use on-chain audio snippets. The result was a dynamic piece of music composed of multiple inscribed parts – effectively a song *living on Bitcoin*. The **“TRUTH”** collection sold out in just over an hour, validating the demand for blockchain-native music experiences. Crane followed up with another track (*“FREEDOM”*) as a free mint, further showcasing how musicians could release work directly to fans via the Bitcoin ledger. These experiments demonstrated the power of Audionals: a beat or melody could be broken into components, stored on-chain, and remixed or “called” by other pieces – introducing **composability** to music NFTs. As Jim explained, “I created a little loop machine… it would find that audio, convert it into a buffer, and play it when I pressed the button,” enabling new songs to build on existing on-chain samples. This concept of **recursive music** opens up endless possibilities – imagine community-driven tracks where anyone can add a layer, or albums that evolve over time on the blockchain.

Crane’s Audionals framework also introduced **on-chain audio sample libraries** to Bitcoin. For instance, the **OB1 Library** (Audionals 2.0) became the first collection of studio-quality audio samples inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Each sample (drum hits, synth tones, etc.) was encoded in high fidelity (lossless WAV format) and permanently stored via Ordinals, complete with metadata such as key, tempo, and creator info. This meant producers anywhere could trustlessly access and use these sounds, with the blockchain verifying the origin and ownership of each sample. Audionals provides tools like the **Audional Sample Pad (OrdSPD)** – a web-based sampler and sequencer – that lets users mix and play these on-chain sounds in real time. By combining transparent metadata and Base64-encoded audio data in Bitcoin transactions, Crane essentially turned the Bitcoin ledger into a global, collaborative music studio. Building on this foundation, he went a step further in May 2025 by pairing the same transparent metadata with Opus-compressed audio and wrapping those tracks in a mobile-ready WebM container—an innovation that made recursive, on-chain music fully compatible with both desktop and mobile playback. This breakthrough not only stores album-quality sound immutably at a fraction of its original size but also slashes inscription fees and bandwidth requirements, dramatically **lowering cost barriers** for independent producers, casual listeners, and application builders alike. The result is a far more fertile ecosystem for recursive DAWs, on-chain sample libraries, and an entirely new generation of decentralised music apps to flourish on Bitcoin.

Perhaps Jim.BTC’s most ambitious vision is the **Bitcoin Audional Matrix (BAM)** – a decentralised Web3 digital audio workstation concept built on Audionals. First unveiled in April 2025, **BAM** is envisioned as a **modular on-chain DAW** where samples, synthesiser instruments, and audio effects (even plugin code) all live on Bitcoin. In this framework, an entire music production environment could exist without centralised servers: artists would load instrument NFTs and sample NFTs from their wallets into a composition grid (the “matrix”), create music, and inscribe the final mix back to Bitcoin. According to Crane, BAM will be *“laying the on-chain bedrock for composable music”* – a foundation uniting high-fidelity audio components with Bitcoin’s permanence. Each element in a song (a drum loop, a synth riff, etc.) can be tracked to its original creator via on-chain metadata, simplifying rights management and attribution. The **BAM protocol** leverages recursive inscriptions to reference existing audio data instead of duplicating it, making the system efficient and scalable. While still in development, the Bitcoin Audional Matrix represents the culmination of Jim Crane’s innovative journey: a future where a full-featured music studio operates *on* Bitcoin itself, owned and run by its users.


Always looking ahead, Jim.BTC will be fostering  **collaborations and new on-chain sample libraries** through Audionals. A prime example will be the **KP Loops** project – a partnership with **Kieron Pepper**, former live drummer of The Prodigy. In this collaboration, Pepper has recorded 25 exclusive drum loops, which Crane will inscribe onto Bitcoin as part of Audionals’ library of sounds. Branded as “KP Loops”, each pattern is a high-energy breakbeat or groove reflecting Pepper’s 30-year career in electronic rock, soon to be immortalised on-chain. These loops will be packaged with rich metadata (tempo, genre, etc.) and will be plugged directly into Audionals-powered apps or future BAM sessions. The KP Loops collection will not only add a legendary musician’s touch to the Audionals ecosystem, but will also exemplify the  **decentralised ownership model** – each loop NFT will be owned by a collector and will be traced and credited automatically whenever it’s remixed or used in new compositions. Jim has hinted that more such collaborations are in the pipeline, as he envisions renowned producers and artists contributing to a growing on-chain audio library (much like a decentralised sound bank for creators).This community-driven approach, combined with optional royalty mechanisms powered by benevolent marketplaces, could ensure that everyone from original artist to remixer receives fair recognition and even revenue share—automatically distributed by reading raw on-chain data and attributing contributions across all elements used in the song’s creation, from audio samples and MIDI recordings to a host of BVST plug-ins that now exist as identifiable, creditable entities in this emerging Web3 music production environment.

## Legacy and Vision

From his early days as *Melophonic* making records in Brighton, to importing the first Bitcoin ATM, to launching cultural NFT moments on Stacks, and now engineering the future of music on Bitcoin – **Jim Crane’s journey is defined by innovation across disciplines**. As **Jim.BTC**, he bridges the gap between musical artistry and blockchain technology, demonstrating how the two worlds can empower each other. His work has consistently achieved “firsts” – the first Bitcoin-secured NFTs with multimedia art, the first music NFT collection on Stacks, the first generative art on Stacks, and the first on-chain music framework on Bitcoin – all of which highlight his pioneering spirit and creative vision. Crane’s story is one of a creator who constantly adapts and pushes boundaries: whether it’s managing bands or managing code, minting beats or minting blocks, he is driven by a passion to break new ground.

Looking ahead, Jim.BTC aspires to a world where **artists have full autonomy over their work through decentralised tech**. By building open-source music tools on the most secure blockchain, he is laying the groundwork for a new creator economy – one where songs and sounds are *“stacked”* on Bitcoin and accessible to all, and where collaboration and attribution are baked into the platform itself. This inspiring vision, combined with his proven track record, makes Jim Crane a true trailblazer at the intersection of music, NFTs, and Bitcoin-based creative tooling. His career is a testament to the idea that technology can amplify creativity rather than replace it, empowering artists to reach global audiences on their own terms.
