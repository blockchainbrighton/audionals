**888 On-Chain Audio-Visual NFTs — Your Passport to the Bitcoin Audional Matrix**

### 1. Why 888?

Audionauts is the **prologue to every future Bitcoin Audional Matrix (BAM) sample library**. Its supply of **888 NFTs** deliberately foreshadows the **88-sample format** of KP Loops and all upcoming BAM drops. Holding an Audionaut puts you one step ahead whenever a new 88-piece library lands.

### 4. Rarity Snapshot

* **Ultra-Rare (≈1 %)** – top-tier animation + badge combos appear **once**.
* **Rare (≈10 %)** – limited to ≤10 mints each.
* **Uncommon/Common (≈89 %)** – balanced for accessibility while preserving distinctiveness.

All rarity logic is deterministic and verifiable on-chain.

* **Gasless Playback** – assets stream directly from the chain; no IPFS or off-site servers.
