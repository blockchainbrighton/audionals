  <h1>Jim.BTC (Jim Crane)</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.2em;color:var(--muted);max-width:700px;margin:auto;font-style:italic;">Music Producer • Blockchain Pioneer • Creator of Audionals</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="history">Two Decades in Music Production</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Jim Crane</b> – known by the monikers <b>Jim.BTC</b> (<b>jimdotbtc</b> on social) and formerly by his music alias <b>Melophonic</b> – is a British music producer and innovator with 20+ years in the music industry. Based in Brighton, UK, he honed his craft as a producer and songwriter, contributing to diverse projects and bands. Notably, Crane was half of the Brighton-based ukulele duo <b><i>Hundred Little Reasons</i></b> and part of the electronic group <b><i>Let The Machines Do The Work</i></b>, showcasing his versatility from acoustic songwriting to dance music production.
  </p>
  <p>
    This extensive background in music <b>production</b> and live performance laid the groundwork for Crane’s later innovations at the intersection of music and technology. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, under the <b>Melophonic</b> alias, he built a reputation for sonic craftsmanship—experiences that would eventually inspire his foray into blockchain-based music creativity.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="collection">From Bitcoin ATM to NFT Pioneer</h2>
  <p>
    Crane’s curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit led him into the world of cryptocurrency early. In 2014, he made headlines by importing <b>the UK’s first two-way Bitcoin ATM</b>, a bold move that marked his entry into the crypto space. This pioneering encounter with Bitcoin ignited his interest in blockchain technology and its potential beyond finance.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “I was technically minded but had no idea about finance... Once I got into crypto, I started learning about code, and that learning formed into what it is now.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    By early 2021, Jim Crane co-founded <b>This Is #1</b>, the world’s first curated Bitcoin NFT marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain (a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts). With Crane as a driving force, <i>This Is #1</i> launched a groundbreaking inaugural NFT collection—the first <b>commercial audio-visual NFT series</b> on Bitcoin via Stacks. This genesis collection featured one-of-one collaborations with internationally acclaimed artists: <b>Cara Delevingne</b>, <b>Fatboy Slim</b>, <b>Orbital</b>, and <b>Dave Stewart</b> (Eurythmics). The piece <i>“Mine”</i> by Cara Delevingne in collaboration with <b>Chemical X</b> became the first NFT minted and auctioned via Stacks (anchored to Bitcoin) in July 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crane and his team continued to break new ground with <b>No.1 Smileys</b>—a series of 1000 audio-visual NFTs created by Fatboy Slim and Chemical X for Stacks. <i>No.1 Smileys</i> became the <b>first-ever music NFT collection</b> on Stacks, each token featuring original beats and iconic smiley-themed artwork, marking the <b>first time Fatboy Slim released music as an NFT</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not stopping there, Jim Crane spearheaded the <b>Hash Ones</b> collection: the <b></b>first generative art NFT collection</b> on Stacks. 91 unique artworks were minted, each sold for just 1 STX to demonstrate the platform’s marketplace. In collaboration with Chemical X, these NFTs were procedurally generated, showcasing creative code-based art on Bitcoin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through <i>This Is #1</i> and these early collections, Jim Crane established himself as a <b>pioneer of Bitcoin NFTs</b>, proving Bitcoin’s security and permanence could be harnessed for creative expression and digital collectibles.
  </p>

  <h2 class="payload">Audionals: On-Chain Music Innovation</h2>
  <p>
    In 2023, Jim Crane (widely known as <b>Jim.BTC</b>) turned his focus fully toward Bitcoin itself—specifically the emerging <b>Ordinals</b> protocol, which enables content to be inscribed directly on Bitcoin. Motivated by a vision to fix the “broken” music industry model (especially around royalties and artist rights), he conceived <b>Audionals</b>: a suite of tools and standards for <b>on-chain music production</b> and distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Audionals lets musicians and developers inscribe audio files and music data <b>directly onto Bitcoin</b>, creating Bitcoin-native digital assets. Songs, samples, and even instruments become on-chain entities, with authorship and attribution made permanently visible and immutable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Audionals pioneered <b>on-chain audio sample libraries</b> with the <b>OB1 Library</b>, the first collection of studio-quality audio samples inscribed onto Bitcoin—each entry offering high-fidelity sound and rich metadata. Companion tools such as the <b>Audional Sample Pad (OrdSPD)</b> let creators play and remix these on-chain sounds live in the browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building on that foundation, Jim.BTC released <i>“TRUTH”</i> in mid-2024—the <b>first recursive music NFT collection on Bitcoin</b>. The project employs recursive techniques to reference and re-use OB1’s on-chain snippets, further expanding the possibilities of blockchain-native composition.
  </p>  
  <p>
    In 2025, Jim pushed further by introducing mobile-ready, Opus-compressed audio in WebM containers—enabling album-quality, on-chain music playback at a fraction of the size and cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    His most ambitious vision: the <b>Bitcoin Audional Matrix (BAM)</b>—a fully on-chain, modular digital audio workstation where every sample, synth, and plug-in is a Bitcoin-native NFT, loaded from your wallet and composed directly on the blockchain.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Jim.BTC is now fostering collaborations and new on-chain sample libraries</b>, starting with the <b>KP Loops</b> project—25 exclusive drum loops by <b>Kieron Pepper</b> (ex-The Prodigy), inscribed on Bitcoin for the Audionals library. Each loop, with rich metadata, is fully composable in Audionals-powered apps and BAM sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>This community-driven approach, with optional royalties powered by benevolent marketplaces, ensures everyone—from original artist to remixer—can be recognized and fairly rewarded by tracking on-chain data across every element used, from audio samples to plug-ins, in this emerging Web3 music production ecosystem.</b>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="utility">Legacy and Vision</h2>
  <p>
    From <i>Melophonic</i> in Brighton, to importing the first Bitcoin ATM, launching the first Stacks music NFTs, and now engineering music’s future on Bitcoin—<b>Jim Crane’s journey is defined by cross-discipline innovation</b>. As <b>Jim.BTC</b>, he bridges artistry and blockchain, achieving consistent “firsts” and shaping the foundation for a new, open creator economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jim.BTC aspires to a world where <b>artists have full autonomy over their work through decentralized tech</b>. His tools ensure songs and sounds are <i>“stacked”</i> on Bitcoin and accessible to all, with collaboration and attribution baked into the platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the Audionauts NFT collection and Web3 music community grow, <b>Jim.BTC ensures music on the blockchain becomes a revolution—not just an experiment—in how art is created, owned, and experienced.</b>
