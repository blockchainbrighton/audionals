## **🚀 Campaign Command Brief: Audionauts Twitter Launch**

### **1. One-Pager – Everything You Need to Know**

| Element | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Product** | 888 interactive astronaut-helmet apps (Ordinals) | Each is a self-contained song-player that streams the 2'30" *Opus of Efficiency* in high-fidelity, plus a 2'30" reveal animation. |
| **Core Hook** | “Your on-chain passport to the Bitcoin Audional Matrix (BAM)” | It’s the first key to a fully on-chain DAW; holders get permanent priority on every future 88-sample library. |
| **Tech Flex** | 100 % on-chain (Bitcoin / Ordinals), zero-gas playback, Opus compression | Mobile-ready, immutable, no external servers—solves every broken-link problem in NFT audio. |
| **Easter-Egg Vault** | Pixel-art synth, 8-track sequencer, recursive music-video generator, HUD visual presentations | WIP; tease them as “unlockable modules” rather than confirmed. |
| **Artist Lore** | Jim.BTC = 20-year producer (Melophonic, ex-Prodigy drummer KP Loops), imported UK’s first Bitcoin ATM, launched first Stacks music NFTs w/ Cara Delevingne & Fatboy Slim, built OB1 & TRUTH (first recursive song on BTC). | Credibility: he keeps shipping firsts. |
| **Rarity System** | 1 % Legendary (1/888), 10 % Epic (≤10/888), 89 % Rare/Common | Deterministic, on-chain verifiable. |
| **Mint** | 31 July 2025 | Price TBA (assume ≈0.03–0.05 BTC). |
| **Campaign Windows** | **Week 1 (quiet tease)** → **Week 2 (loud reveal)** | 2-week sprint. |

### **2. The Two-Week Twitter Flight Plan**

#### **🌑 Week 1 – “Silent Ignition” (Mon 21 → Thu 24 July)**
Goal: seed curiosity without revealing art.

| Day | Tweet Format | Example Copy | Visual | Hashtags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mon 21** | Launch countdown graphic | “14 days until the next audio singularity. #Audionauts” | Retro countdown clock (no helmet) | #Ordinals #BitcoinMusic |
| **Tue 22** | 1-line riddle | “888 helmets. 2’30” of audio immortality. Can you hear the silence?” | Static starfield | |
| **Wed 23** | 15-sec audio teaser (no visuals) | A 5-sec clip of *Opus of Efficiency* reversed & reverb-washed | Black waveform on dark bg | |
| **Thu 24** | Jim selfie video | “20 years producing, 1 BTC ATM, 0 servers. Something launches in 7 days.” | Vertical selfie | |

**Engagement hack:**  
Pin a thread titled “What do you think #Audionauts is?” – retweet the best guesses daily.

#### **☀️ Week 2 – “Full Throttle” (Fri 25 → Wed 30 July)**
Goal: flood timeline with art, utility, FOMO.

**Recurring daily beats:**

| **08:00 UTC** | “Helmet of the Day” | 5-sec looping GIF of one animation | Visual drip |
| **13:00 UTC** | “Utility Byte” | 120-character micro-thread | Explain holder perks (priority mint, governance) |
| **18:00 UTC** | Community clip | RT remix/meme from holders | Social proof |
| **21:00 UTC** | Easter-egg tease | Pixel UI mock-ups (no code) | Scarcity narrative |

**Key Milestones:**

| Day | Big Moment | Asset |
|---|---|---|
| **Fri 25** | **Reveal Trailer** (30 sec) | Helmet opens, song kicks in, tagline: “Own the Icon. Navigate the Matrix.” |
| **Sat 26** | **Jim Twitter Space** | Topic: “Why on-chain music matters” – guest cameos from KP & Fatboy Slim |
| **Sun 27** | **Rarity Deep-dive thread** | Static rarity sheet + Legendary 1/888 mock-up |
| **Mon 28** | **Collector Giveaway** | 3 whitelist spots for best fan art (quote-tweet) |

If pixel synth or sequencer is locked before mint:

- **Soft-announce** on Tue 29 as “Module-01 will drop post-mint to all holders.”  
- **Hard-commit** only if dev signs off; otherwise keep it aspirational.

---

### **5. Post-Mint Fade-Out (31 July onward)**

- 1-hr “Lift-off” Twitter Space with live helmet reveals.  
- RT holder first-plays (record screen, tag #AudionautsFirstSpin).  
- Snapshot & airdrop teaser for KP Loops priority.

**HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH AUDIENCE IN WEEK 1 of 2:**

---

# Week 1 Objective

Make people *lean in* without ever letting them see the helmet or hear the full track.
Everything should feel like a breadcrumb dropped by Mission Control that only a curious astronaut would pick up.

---

# Guiding Rules

* Zero finished art.
* Zero song snippets longer than 1.5 seconds.
* Every interaction must *ask* for a reaction (reply, quote, RT, poll).
* Use Jim’s personal account as the “voice from the cockpit”; **@Audionals** stays silent until Week 2.

---

# Daily Playbook (Mon 21 → Thu 24)

### MON 21 – “Countdown Begins”

* **Tweet 1 (08:00 UTC) – Jim**

  * Static image: black square with cyan `14:00:00:00` countdown digits.
  * Copy:

    > “14 days. No previews. No leaks. Just 888 helmets and a song that lives forever on Bitcoin. Tell me where you think it’s going. #Audionauts”
  * Engagement hook: Quote-tweet guesses pinned; best guess gets a follow-back.

* **Tweet 2 (20:00 UTC) – Poll**

  > Choose your launch soundtrack:
  > A) Silence
  > B) One reversed cymbal
  > C) A single sine-wave
  > D) White-noise burst
  > Vote closes in 24 h.
  > (No audio attached; curiosity driver.)

---

### TUE 22 – “Telemetry Drop”

* **Tweet 1 (12:00 UTC) – Image**

  * A blank starfield with one blinking cyan dot.
  * Alt-text: “Signal received. Source: unknown.”
  * Copy:

    > “Coordinates locked. Reply with the emoji that best describes what you *feel* when you see this.”
  * Engagement: RT the most creative emojis.

* **Tweet 2 (21:00 UTC) – 6-sec audio (no visual)**

  * Upload a *spectrogram* of the first 1.5 s of *Opus of Efficiency*.
  * Copy:

    > “This is not the music. This is the *shape* of the music. Decode it if you dare.”
  * Add link to a free web spectrogram tool → drives traffic & time-on-post.

---

### WED 23 – “Mission Patch Reveal (Sort Of)”

* **Tweet 1 (10:00 UTC) – Jim selfie video (vertical, 15 s)**

  > “I stitched something into every patch. You’ll see it only if you’re wearing the helmet. Guess what it is 👀”

  * Engagement hook: Top 3 replies get their Twitter handle added to a hidden metadata field in one of the final helmets (a micro-easter-egg).

* **Tweet 2 (18:00 UTC) – Thread**

  * 4-tweet thread titled **“Why 888?”**

    * T1: piano keys (88)
    * T2: spacecraft panels (8)
    * T3: infinity symbol (∞)
    * T4: asks followers to reply with their own 888 meaning → best answer wins an invite to the pre-mint private Space.

---

### THU 24 – “Riddle & Recap”

* **Tweet 1 (08:00 UTC) – Text-only**

  > “I am the absence of servers.
  > I am the presence of sound.
  > I am 888 windows into a matrix you already own.
  > What am I?”

  * Pin this tweet all day; RT the smartest answers.

* **Tweet 2 (20:00 UTC) – Jim voice note (30 s)**

  * Low-fi recording:

    > “Tomorrow the visor cracks open. Bring your questions to the Space at 21:00 UTC. No visuals. Just voices.”
  * Link to Twitter Space scheduled for Fri 25 21:00 UTC (perfect bridge to Week 2).

---

# Cross-Channel Micro-Tactics

* **DM warm-list:** Every reply containing “Audionauts” gets a heart + short DM:

  > “Glad you’re on the mission. Keep watch tomorrow 🚀”

* **Hashtag rotation:** Use #Ordinals and #BitcoinMusic in 1 of 3 tweets to avoid spam flags.

* **Community spotlight:** Quote-tweet any fan art of *imagined* helmets with:

  > “Not the final design, but the vibe is real.”

---

# Metrics to Watch

* Replies-per-tweet target: **≥ 25**
* Organic quote-tweets: **≥ 10 per day**
* Twitter Space reminder tweet saves: **≥ 200 by Thu midnight**

> If those numbers hit, we know the whisper campaign is working and Week 2 will start with an already-primed audience.

INTERACTION NBOOSTERS WEEK 


# Week 1 Interaction Booster: Mini-Missions

Turn every teaser into a mini-mission that can’t be completed without replying, remixing, or inviting a friend.
Below are **10 ultra-light interaction plays** you can bolt onto the existing Week-1 schedule (or swap in as needed). Each one is designed to feel native to Twitter and to give people micro-rewards before any art is ever shown.

---

## 1. Decode the Glitch (Visual Cipher)

* Post a 4-frame looping GIF that flashes a single 8×8 pixel pattern for 0.2 s every loop.
* Tweet copy:

  > “Capture the 8×8 grid and drop it as a reply. First 8 correct answers get added to a pre-launch whitelist.”
* **Effect:** Forces screen-record & reply.

---

## 2. Reverse-Engineer the BPM (Audio Puzzle)

* 1-second audio clip of a hi-hat loop, reversed.
* Quote-tweet:

  > “Guess the BPM. Closest without going over wins a 1-of-1 animated badge GIF (non-NFT, just flex).”
* **Effect:** Drives quote-tweets + discussion threads.

---

## 3. Tag-a-Copilot (Network Effect)

* Simple tweet:

  > “If you had to pick ONE account to co-pilot your Audionaut helmet, who & why?”
* Rule: must tag them + use hashtag **#AudionautsPick**.
* **Effect:** Viral loops via mentions.

---

## 4. Emoji Telemetry (Poll Remix)

* Run a poll with 4 emojis as options.
* After poll closes, reply to every voter with a unique auto-DM containing a single scrambled word from the *Opus of Efficiency* lyrics.
* “Collect all 4 words from friends’ DMs to unscramble the first line.”
* **Effect:** Forces sharing screenshots in group DMs.

---

## 5. Spectrogram Scavenger

* Upload a PNG that looks like random static.
* Alt-text contains a clue:

  > “Convert to audio.”
* First 5 users who run it through a tool and post the resulting waveform as a reply receive a secret Twitter Space link for Friday.

---

## 6. Pixel-Perfect Reply (Quote-Tweet Art)

* Post a blank 32×32 transparent PNG.
* Challenge:

  > “Fill the void. Quote-tweet with whatever you think belongs inside an Audionaut helmet.”
* **Effect:** Generates UGC memes; Jim RTs the 3 most creative.

---

## 7. Chain-Link Story (Thread Starter)

* Tweet 1:

  > “Once upon a time, 888 helmets drifted through the mempool…”
* Each reply must add **ONE sentence** continuing the story.
* At 88 sentences, Jim mints the finished story as a free text inscription and airdrops the inscription ID to every participant.

---

## 8. Countdown Collab

* Pin a 4-day countdown GIF.
* Every 24 h, change the last digit to a QR code linking to a Typeform with ONE question:

  > “What sample pack would you drop on Bitcoin first?”
* After form closes, publish the top 3 answers back to the feed and tag the authors.

---

## 9. Reply-Only Preview

* Tweet:

  > “The next tweet will self-delete in 15 min. Turn on notifications.”
* 15 minutes later: post a 3-word clue, then delete.
* **Effect:** Forces notifications & quick engagement.

---

## 10. Follow-Fractal

* Create a private Twitter List called **“Early Audionauts.”**
* Rule: anyone who retweets and replies to any Week-1 tweet gets added.
* On Friday, screenshot the list and post:

  > “These 200+ explorers get first dibs on tomorrow’s reveal trailer link.”
* **Effect:** Gamifies RT + reply every single day.

---

# Execution Tips

* Use Twitter’s native reply controls: set “Who can reply?” to **“Accounts you follow”** when running limited-seat games (keeps bots out).
* Schedule all puzzle tweets at off-peak hours (e.g., 03:00 UTC) so the global community has an equal shot.
* Keep prize payloads tiny (whitelist spot, early Space link, or a shout-out) to avoid regulatory gray zones.
* Track via TweetDeck column for hashtag + keyword (“Audionauts”) to surface every micro-interaction in real time.

---

**Pro Tip:** Drop any **three** of these mini-missions into the existing Week-1 calendar and you’ll **2–3× the reply volume** without ever showing a helmet.
