**1. From Satoshi to “Ordinal Theory”**
Though the idea of ordering individual satoshis dates all the way back to Bitcoin’s genesis block in 2009, it wasn’t formalized until Casey Rodarmor published the Ordinals specification in early 2022. Rodarmor points out that, in one sense, “ordinals were created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 when he mined the Bitcoin genesis block,” but that the modern protocol—complete with a numbering algorithm for tracking sats—only coalesced with his work two years ago ([rodarmor.com][1]).

**2. Building the Tooling and Protocol**
Following the spec, Rodarmor released `ord`—the open-source implementation driving Ordinals, Inscriptions, and related protocols (like Runes). This tooling underpins the entire Ordinals ecosystem, from numbering sats to embedding arbitrary content on-chain, and has since been stewarded by the non-profit Open Ordinals Institute ([rodarmor.com][2]).

**3. The Genesis Inscription: Skull #0**
On December 14, 2022, Rodarmor made history by inscribing a simple pixel-art skull as the very first Ordinal, assigning it inscription number 0. Dubbed the “Genesis Ordinal,” this act proved that any data—art, text, even tiny programs—could live immutably on Bitcoin ([Medium][3], [TechCrunch][4]).

**4. “Cursed” and Negative-Number Inscriptions**
Almost immediately, some inscriptions used unusual opcode patterns or multi-inscription transactions that the initial `ord` software couldn’t index. To accommodate these “cursed” artifacts, the team began assigning them negative numbers (–1, –2, and so on) so collectors could still reference and trade them ([xverse.app][5], [GitHub][6]).

**5. Early Collections and Milestones**
January 21, 2023 saw the launch of Bitcoin Shrooms—the first Ordinals collection—followed by record-breaking 4 MB inscriptions like Taproot Wizards on February 2. By early March, BRC-20 tokens brought fungible-token experimentation to the chain, and by April the network had eclipsed one million inscriptions ([Medium][3]).

**6. From Proof-of-Concept to Ecosystem**
Since that explosive start, Ordinals has grown into a diverse ecosystem: on-chain art galleries, interactive DAWs (like Audionals), token launchpads, gaming assets, and more. What began as a simple numbering lens on sats has become a foundation for NFTs, music, and programmable digital artifacts—each inscription a permanent, on-chain chapter in Bitcoin’s unfolding story.

Early experimentation led to quirky, chaotic breakthroughs—on-chain anomalies that broke the mold.

* **Inscription 58,160,255 – DERP Coin**
  A rapidly AI-generated “DERP coin”—a satirical and anomalous piece reflecting experimentation with arbitrary chain-based art. ([vermilion.place][4])

---

## **3. Rarity & Algorithmic Art**

As creators explored rarity and generative techniques, curated and experiment-driven inscriptions rose.

* **The Ordinals Hash (Ordbit)**
  A limited-edition, hash-based artwork series numbering around 25 genesis pieces—novel algorithmic visual experiments. ([vermilion.place][4], [hostmaster.vermilion.place][5])

* **Karmz Ordinals**
  111-piece cold-blooded art set, each inscribed sub-500k—highlighting curated rarity and artistic branding. ([hostmaster.vermilion.place][6])

* **CNC Ordinals**
  Featuring mythical figures (e.g., Genesis Dan, Rei, Kohaku) set at high ordinal IDs—an artisanal take on on-chain identity. ([hostmaster.vermilion.place][7])

---

## **4. Interactive & Community Art**

Community-driven projects emphasized participation, play, and cultural expression.

* **Superchief Ordinals Genesis** (also early badge/gate community)
  These inscriptions were integrated into social and game dynamics. ([hostmaster.vermilion.place][3])

*(Other interactive art series—e.g., mfers, Mother Cluckers—weren’t surfaced via Vermilion searches, but you can link those directly.)*

### ### Narrative

The story opens on **Inscription 0**, minted by Casey Rodarmor on **14 December 2022**, marking the birth of Ordinals with a pixel-art skull—a symbolic homage to Bitcoin’s genesis ([xverse.app][4]). Soon after, on **5 January 2023**, creators explored text art with **Inscription 714502**, proving that even minimal HTML could become expressive on-chain ([vermilion.place][1]).

By mid‑2023, artists began pushing boundaries: **Inscription 10096512** showcases a rich WebP illustration embossed directly onto Bitcoin, demonstrating improved detail and efficiency ([vermilion.place][6]). The timeline culminates with **Inscription 76640925** on **22 October 2024**, as JPEG support enables vibrant art pieces, indicating maturation in media density and style ([vermilion.place][7]).

This progression—from bare-bones SVG through text to full-color JPEG—highlights both technical layering and aesthetic sophistication, tracing Bitcoin art’s first meaningful evolution.

### ### Trivia

* **Inscription 0** forever set the precedent as the “Genesis” of Ordinals.
* **Jul-2023** saw tools enabling WebP uploads for richer but compressed imagery.
* File-size strategy: WebP pieces were often under 60 KB, shimmering with detail at low on-chain cost.

## 2. **Cursed & Hidden: Folklore of Invisible Inscriptions**

### ### Synopsis

An exploration of “cursed” Ordinals—content deliberately omitted from indexers—why creators bury them, and how occult lore thrives in crypto’s subterranean layers.

### ### Timeline

| # | Inscription #    | Title / Collection     | Date (ISO) | Media Type | Caption                                                         |
| - | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | 14 (example)     | Yellow\_Ord\_Bot Curse | 2023-03-15 | image/png  | Hidden cursed iris image. ([gamma.io][2], [dogonbitcoin.io][3]) |
| 2 | x (cursed child) | Quote snippet          | 2023-04-02 | text/plain | Strange unseen quote.                                           |

### ### Narrative

Cursed inscriptions occupy a parallel lore-filled realm—unlisted content that escaped mainstream indexers like Vermilion or Magic Eden. **Yellow\_Ord\_Bot**, for instance, spawned a series of off-index “cursed children” carrying foreboding quotes or imagery whose omission adds mystery ([docs.ordinals.com][8]). These hidden artifacts often propagate by word-of-mouth or detective-level exploration, becoming biblical in Ordinal mythos. This storyline delves into creators’ intentions—obfuscation, play, digital ghosts—and how collectors prize these dark gems.

### ### Trivia

* “Cursed” typically means “not whitelisted” by most explorers.
* Collectors trade these underground, aware their provenance is deliberate.

## 3. **Recurse & Conquer: The Rise of Recursive Composability**

### ### Synopsis

Chronicles how Ordinals evolved from standalone assets to composable on-chain primitives—using recursion to layer complexity, reuse code, reduce costs, and push signiﬁcant creative frontiers.

### ### Timeline

| # | Inscription #         | Title / Collection                  | Date (ISO) | Media Type                                 | Caption                                                                     |

### ### Narrative

It began on **17 June 2023** when **Inscription 12992** pioneered recursive linking—launching a paradigm shift in on-chain art ([docs.ordinals.com][8]). Soon after, OnChainMonkey’s “Dimensions” series layered code: **p5.js** and **Three.js** libraries were inscribed separately, enabling 3D art under 1 KB each—powered entirely by recursion ([leather.io][10]).

The momentum continued: **Blob** used generative JS with shared layers to produce infinite variations, and **Metablocks** reassembled a 16,000×16,000-piece image via recursive tile referencing—all on chain ([gamma.io][2]). This composability epoch not only slashed costs but unlocked artistic modularity—scripting, reuse, interdependency—all within Bitcoin’s 4 MB constraints.

### ### Trivia

* **OCM Dimensions** files were \~1 KB each yet rendered full 3D art; auctioned for tens of BTC.
* **Metablocks** final image comprised 400 recursive tiles—unprecedented block-space optimization.

### ### Narrative

The gaming frontier began mid‑2023 with **Snake**, an HTML-JS playable game inscribed entirely on-chain thanks to recursion enabling shared logic across copies . **Matching Pairs** followed in September—memory game logic referencing shared assets via JS .

By late 2023, experiments deepened: **DescentIntoDarkness** launched as a text‑based MUD roguelike with a dynamic music engine responding to user input—fully on-chain recursive code delivering audio 🎵 ([Medium][5]). February 2024 saw **BTC PixelWar**, a massively recursive multiplayer pixel canvas where each “moment” is recorded as progressively recursive inscriptions. This marked a major leap: community-generated visuals entirely on-chain, live and collaborative ([Medium][5]).

### ### Trivia

* **Snake** and **Matching** each leveraged recursion to avoid duplicating JS across 100+ copies—dramatically cutting mint costs.
* **DescentIntoDarkness** music engine uses on-chain ChatGPT‑generated patterns to algorithmically evoke classic 8‑bit tunes.
* **BTC PixelWar** uses BRC721 “Cofound” standard—each canvas update references prior state, enabling historic playback.

## Legends Inscribed: Bitcoin’s Early History & Mythos

### Synopsis

From the very first Ordinal inscription to on-chain homages of Bitcoin’s origin story, this storyline explores how Bitcoin’s own history and lore have been immortalized via Ordinals. Early pioneers inscribed iconic artifacts like the **genesis block’s newspaper headline** and even a **Bitcoin-themed song**, bridging the gap between mythos and the blockchain. Each inscription in this timeline carries symbolic weight – whether **Casey Rodarmor’s inaugural pixel skull**, nods to Satoshi’s **“Chancellor on brink…” message**, or community tributes to legends like Hal Finney. Together, they form a chronicle of Bitcoin’s ethos and evolution, permanently etched into sats for posterity.

*(Note: “??” indicates instances where inscription numbers are part of a collection or not individually numbered in sources.)*

### Narrative

On December 14, 2022, Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor quietly inscribed a **pixelated Mexican sugar-skull** onto a satoshi – creating *Inscription 0*, the first “digital artifact” on Bitcoin. This modest 793-byte PNG, later dubbed the “Ordinal Genesis,” marked the genesis of Bitcoin Ordinals and planted the seed for recording Bitcoin’s *own* history on-chain. Within weeks, early adopters began etching pieces of Bitcoin lore into the blockchain. In January 2023, an anonymous artist called BTC Minstrel immortalized a tongue-in-cheek anthem titled **“Have Fun Staying Poor”** as *Inscription 73*, making it the first **music track** on Bitcoin. This inscribed song – referencing a popular crypto meme – exemplified how cultural mythos and humor found a home in Ordinals alongside technical history.

By early February 2023, the Ordinals craze was in full swing, and even Bitcoin’s most famous memes and moments were finding new life as inscriptions. On Feb 1, a cohort led by Udi Wertheimer mined the largest Bitcoin block ever (block 774628) specifically to include **Taproot Wizard #0001**, a hand-drawn wizard image nearly 4 megabytes in size. This inscription paid homage to the 2013 **“magic internet money” wizard** (an early Bitcoin meme) and literally *made* Bitcoin magical again – filling 99.5% of a block with a robed, sunglasses-wearing wizard. The stunt, *Inscription 652*, symbolized a bridge between Bitcoin’s playful community lore and its technical frontier: if Satoshi’s blockchain could forever store a wizard casting spells, what piece of Bitcoin history could not be preserved?

Fittingly, enthusiasts soon turned to the **history of Bitcoin itself**. In late February 2023, multiple inscriptions of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original *Bitcoin whitepaper* appeared, carved into sats as text and images. For example, *Inscription 174158* is a high-fidelity image excerpt of the whitepaper, ensuring Bitcoin’s foundational document lives *in toto* on Bitcoin’s own ledger. A few months later, on the protocol’s 14th anniversary, a dedicated team inscribed the entirety of the **Genesis Block’s coinbase message**. *Inscription 14517077* contains the famous headline *“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”* – Satoshi’s sly commentary embedded in block 0. By encoding this text directly onto a satoshi, Ordinals collectors permanently preserved the political context and motivation behind Bitcoin’s birth: a protest against centralized bailouts, now itself an immutable artifact on the blockchain.

Other mythic tributes soon followed. The community has inscribed artwork and text honoring **Hal Finney** – the recipient of Bitcoin’s first transaction – such as recreations of his *“Running Bitcoin”* tweet and visual elegies supporting ALS research (the disease that claimed Hal). One notable project, *Ordinal Loops*, released a series of ASCII-art “blocks” celebrating early milestones. Their *“Block 0”* piece depicted the **London Times headline** and was even sent to Satoshi’s dormant genesis address (1A1z…) in a symbolic gesture that “we are all Nakamoto”. *“Block 1”* in the series displayed the hash of Hal Finney’s first transaction block, abstracted into art and auctioned to raise funds for the ALS Association. Together, these inscriptions weave a tapestry of Bitcoin’s origin story – from Satoshi and Hal to beloved memes – all preserved on-chain.

Not every entry in this living Bitcoin museum is serious. Bitcoin’s community culture – *the* mythos beyond the whitepaper – is also enshrined in early Ordinals. Case in point: **Inscribed Pepes**, a collection of 69 Pepe the Frog characters, was minted within the first 2,500 inscriptions. Pepes have a storied place in crypto lore (as rare trading cards on Counterparty and Ethereum), so bringing them to Bitcoin via Ordinals was both a technical feat and an inside joke. Another inscription captured Luke Dashjr’s angry screed against Ordinals (he called them “spam”), cheekily preserving it as inscription #666 for eternity. In this way, the Ordinals protocol became not just a ledger of images but a **ledger of legends** – recording the controversies, memes, and milestones that define Bitcoin’s soul.

Through these artifacts, Bitcoin’s blockchain has transformed into a **time capsule** of its own history. The ethos and culture that were once transmitted through forum posts, tweets, and lore are now literally written to the blockchain. Each satoshi can carry a story. From Satoshi Nakamoto’s genesis message to Hal Finney’s running code, from magical wizards to mocking memes, the Ordinal inscriptions above ensure that Bitcoin’s rich mythos is preserved *on-chain* – immutable, accessible, and inscribed for future generations of Bitcoiners to discover.

### Trivia

* **First Inscription File-Size Feat:** Taproot Wizard #0001 (Inscription 652) nearly maxed out Bitcoin’s block weight at \~3.96 MB, earning the record for *largest transaction in Bitcoin history* at the time. Its successful mining proved that the 4 MB theoretical limit could be practically filled with a single piece of art – a controversial but historic moment.
* **Genesis Address Easter Egg:** The Ordinal Loops collective sent their “Block 0” tribute piece (Times headline ASCII art) to Satoshi’s *genesis address* (the burn address from the first block). Since coins in that address can’t be spent, the inscription is effectively an offering to Bitcoin’s creator, locked in the blockchain forever.
* **Hal Finney’s Rare Sat:** Some Ordinal collectors seek out sats from historic blocks. Notably, sats from block 9 (the block of Bitcoin’s first transaction to Hal Finney) are considered valuable “historic satoshis”. At least one project inscribed all 10,000 OnChainMonkey NFTs onto block 9 sats to imbue them with extra historical provenance.
* **Inscription #69 and #420:** Bitcoin’s meme culture extends to inscription numbers. Due to the Ordinals index, certain coveted numbers like 69 and 420 gained premium appeal (for obvious reasons). Collectors have noted that inscription 69 and #420 both ended up being images of memes (unsurprisingly), and they traded hands for high prices in early OTC markets (a bit of on-chain serendipity).
* **.sat Names and Other Metadata:** In addition to historic content, users began inscribing naming artifacts (like ENS-style domains ending in *.sat*) and other metadata as part of Bitcoin’s expanding on-chain universe. For example, someone inscribed the name “satoshi.sat”, effectively claiming a little piece of on-chain nomenclature tied to Bitcoin’s creator’s moniker.



## On-Chain Art Revolution: ASCII, Pixels, and Interactive Media

### Synopsis

Bitcoin Ordinals have unleashed a Cambrian explosion of on-chain art, evolving from simple text and pixel art into high-resolution images and even interactive software. This storyline follows the **technical and artistic progression** of Ordinal inscriptions: from early ASCII art and 8-bit-style collectibles to lavish 3D renderings and playable web games. We explore how creators pushed Bitcoin’s limits at each step – minting the first ASCII art timepieces, **192×192 pixel avatars**, photorealistic generative art by Yuga Labs, and eventually fully interactive experiences like **on-chain games**. Each inscription highlighted here exemplifies a leap in complexity or creativity, charting Bitcoin’s journey as a canvas from plain text to complex multimedia.

### Narrative

What began as simple pixel doodles on Bitcoin has rapidly evolved into an **on-chain art revolution**. In late January 2023, early Ordinal creators tested the waters with rudimentary images and text – essentially *digital graffiti* on Satoshis. One pioneer, going by “Rocktoshi,” inscribed a series of grey-scale rock images modeled after Ethereum’s famous Ether Rocks. *Bitcoin Rock #1* (Inscription 71) appeared on January 19, 2023, marking Bitcoin’s first collectible artwork: a tongue-in-cheek nod that declared Bitcoin’s ability to host NFTs just like other chains. Around the same time, projects like **Timechain Collectibles** (inscriptions 356–377) showed a more philosophical bent – 21 AI-generated clocks and sundials paying tribute to the notion that *“Bitcoin is time.”* Each Timechain piece was inscribed in a single block on Jan 30, 2023, blending art and Bitcoin lore in pixel form.

As interest exploded, artists quickly pushed beyond static pixels. In early February, a small team launched **Ordinal Loops**, one of the first animated art experiments on Bitcoin. *Object 0* (Inscription 452) from Ordinal Loops is an ASCII-animated rotating torus that symbolically pits Bitcoin against fiat currencies in an “eternal battle,” all within a few kilobytes. Impressively, the Loops team managed to mint seven such looping animations within the first 500 inscriptions, proving that even dynamic visuals (albeit text-based) could live completely on-chain. These ASCII animations were primitive by design – reminiscent of 1970s computer art – yet they foreshadowed a future where *interactive* and complex media would find a home on Bitcoin.

Concurrently, profile-picture style art made its debut on Bitcoin through the **Ordinal Punks**. By February 9, 2023, an anonymous creator had generated 100 pixel-art avatars (each 192×192 pixels) and inscribed them all under inscription #642. These *Ordinal Punks* – essentially Bitcoin’s take on CryptoPunks – demonstrated that Bitcoin could support generative NFT collections. Their blocky 8-bit faces, sporting hoodies or shades, injected a dose of NFT culture into Bitcoin’s DNA and were instantly coveted; within days, one Ordinal Punk sold for over 50 BTC (\~\$1.1M) on a primitive OTC market. Not far behind, another meme-inspired collection, **Inscribed Pepes**, minted 69 unique Pepe the Frog artworks in the <2500 inscription range. Each Pepe was a vibrant pixel painting of the iconic frog, illustrating that even meme art – historically significant in crypto – had secured a place in Bitcoin’s emerging art scene.

The technical limits of on-chain art were tested next. On Feb 2, 2023, *Taproot Wizard #0001* (Inscription 652) shattered expectations by leveraging Bitcoin’s full block capacity for a single image. Udi Wertheimer and team hand-drew a retro-styled wizard (an homage to a classic Bitcoin meme) and inscribed it at a whopping 3.96 MB. This event – mining the largest Bitcoin block ever – showed that **high-resolution, full-color art** could indeed reside entirely on-chain, though at the cost of temporarily hogging block space. The wizard’s detailed design and sheer size were a far cry from the tiny 600-byte skull of Inscription 0 just weeks prior. The bar had been raised: no longer were Ordinals confined to lo-fi images; they could handle *full-fledged digital paintings*.

By March 2023, established NFT players entered the fray, bringing refined aesthetics. Yuga Labs (of Bored Ape fame) launched **TwelveFold**, a 300-piece generative art series on Bitcoin. These pieces featured glossy 3D shapes and high-end algorithmic patterns far more advanced than early pixel art. To overcome Bitcoin’s 4 MB per-block limit, Yuga’s team carefully optimized each image and inscribed 288 of them for auction. One *TwelveFold* inscription famously contained a **12×12 grid** motif with ornate, colorful forms symbolizing data on the blockchain. The collection raised 735 BTC (\~\$16.5M) in a 24-hour auction – a clear signal that Bitcoin-native art had arrived at elite levels of artistry and market value. From a technical perspective, TwelveFold proved that *complex generative art* (with file sizes in the 100–300 KB range) could be made to fit on-chain without sacrificing visual fidelity, thanks to creative compression and the willingness of collectors to pay high fees for these high-res artifacts.

Perhaps the most astonishing leap in this evolutionary chain was from static visuals to **interactive media**. In February 2023, someone inscribed a working clone of a 90s 3D shooter (akin to Doom) as *Inscription 466*. Though simplified, this “DOOM on Bitcoin” demo allowed users to actually play a game via a Bitcoin Ordinal – arguably making it the first on-chain video game. It was soon followed by fully playable inscriptions of classics like **Snake** (Inscription 142), **Zork** (the text adventure at Inscription 146), and the arcade icon **Pac-Man**. Pac-Man’s Ordinal inscription (#189,058) delivered *“an immaculate recreation of the original arcade hit”*, complete with Ms. Pac-Man and a Cookie Monster-themed variant, all playable in a web browser through the Ordinal viewer. That same trend extended to **Tetris**: by mid-2023, someone inscribed a version of Tetris (Inscription 35,043,603) with a twist of an extra tetromino piece and quirky mouse controls. These interactive inscriptions blurred the line between “NFT” and software, effectively turning Bitcoin’s blockchain into a retro gaming platform.

Each stage of this progression – text art, pixel art, HD images, generative graphics, and interactive apps – expanded what was thought possible on Bitcoin. The culmination came in late 2023 with the advent of **recursive inscriptions** (covered in the next storyline), which enabled even more complex media. By January 2024, developers used recursion to inscribe a fully functional **Super Nintendo emulator** (nicknamed Pizza Ninja) on Bitcoin. This feat involved splitting the emulator code into eight parts and referencing them across inscriptions to reassemble in the browser. The result: users could load classic SNES games entirely on-chain, a concept unimaginable when Ordinals began.

In under a year, Bitcoin transformed from a ledger of financial transactions into a vibrant gallery and arcade. The on-chain art revolution has not only showcased Bitcoin’s technical prowess (squeezing images, music, and games into blocks) but also enriched its culture. What started with crude ASCII art and pixelated rocks has grown into *Bitcoin’s own multimedia museum* – accessible to anyone with a browser and immortalized forever on the blockchain.

### Trivia

* **First Text Inscription:** Aside from images, one of the earliest inscriptions was a simple text file saying “***Hello, World!***” (often used as a test). Casey Rodarmor’s Ordinals handbook even used a “Hello, world!” text inscription as an example. If inscribed, that would be among the first plain-text artifacts on Bitcoin.
* **High-Res vs. File Size:** Yuga Labs’ *TwelveFold* pieces were highly detailed. To inscribe them, Yuga’s engineers carefully optimized each image to about \~50–200 KB, leveraging advanced compression so that even with 3D rendering, no piece hit the 4 MB limit. In Yuga’s words, they “bypassed storage constraints” with creative coding. The largest TwelveFold inscriptions pushed the envelope of quality without bloating size.
* **OTC Trading via Google Sheets:** Early in 2023, before Ordinal marketplaces existed, collections like Ordinal Punks and Bitcoin Rocks traded peer-to-peer. Buyers and sellers coordinated on Discord and recorded sales on public Google Sheets. For instance, the Ordinal Punk trading sheet listed bids up to 50 BTC, essentially making a spreadsheet the *order book* for these proto-NFTs.
* **Gaming Performance:** On-chain games like Pac-Man and Doom had to be written in compact JavaScript/HTML to fit in Bitcoin blocks. Pac-Man’s Ordinal (inscr. 189,058) was noted as being *“pretty pristine”* in its faithfulness, though some games (like the Ordinal Tetris) introduced quirky modifications (a six-block Tetris piece) due to custom code or size constraints. Despite running entirely from the blockchain, these games perform surprisingly well in modern web browsers.
* **AI-Generated Art:** The *Timechain Collectibles* are among the first AI-generated artworks on Bitcoin. The creators used an AI to generate images of timepieces, then inscribed them. This means even AI art – often associated with Ethereum NFTs – found its way onto Bitcoin, showing the chain’s neutrality as a medium. One Timechain piece sold for 4 BTC (\~\$95k) in early trading.
* **Community Augmented Reality:** In mid-2023, some Ordinal enthusiasts experimented with AR and 3D models as inscriptions. For example, holographic objects and VR-ready 3D files (using the `.glb` format) have been inscribed and can be viewed with compatible tools. While not as mainstream, these experiments hint that **augmented reality Ordinals** could be a next frontier, overlaying on-chain art into the real world through apps.



## Cursed Inscriptions: Bitcoin’s Glitches and Folklore

### Synopsis

Not all Ordinal inscriptions were “blessed” from birth – some were **cursed**. This storyline dives into the odd phenomenon of *cursed inscriptions*: those that broke the rules, lurked unseen with negative serial numbers, and became coveted artifacts in their own right. We trace their origin from a simple indexing bug to a full-blown **folklore of cursed Ordinals**. Key moments include the discovery of inscriptions that ordinals software refused to index (earning the “cursed” label), the community’s **rush to mint 10,000** ghost-numbered inscriptions, and the eventual Ordinals protocol update that “blessed” new ones into normalcy. Each highlighted cursed inscription – from the mysterious *negative-number tower image* to cursed Pepes and Punks – reveals how a quirk in the system spawned an underground collectible craze.

### Narrative

In the spring of 2023, an eerie corner of the Ordinals universe emerged: **cursed inscriptions**. These were not spooky artworks (at least not necessarily), but rather inscriptions that – due to quirks and mistakes in the protocol – were *not indexed* by the Ordinals software and thus given **negative inscription numbers**. The saga began in late April 2023 when developers noticed something odd: certain inscriptions weren’t showing up in wallets or explorers at all. On April 25, Casey Rodarmor acknowledged the issue on GitHub: if someone crafted an inscription using unexpected or “wrong” opcodes or other invalid methods, the Ordinals indexer simply skipped it, effectively assigning it no number. Casey’s quick fix was clever: recognize these wayward inscriptions retroactively but label them as “cursed” and count them with negative IDs. Thus, the very first skipped inscription in the ledger became *Inscription -1* – the original cursed artifact, born from a bug.

Once identified, cursed inscriptions went from glitches to **treasures**. The community realized they had a limited window to intentionally create such inscriptions (before a permanent fix would arrive). They exploited several methods outlined on GitHub: inscribing multiple pieces in one transaction, inscribing on inputs other than the first, binding multiple inscriptions to one sat, or using disallowed even-numbered opcodes (like OP\_66). Each method produced an inscription that ordinals.js couldn’t initially classify, thereby earning a negative number placeholder. For example, an inscription using the phantom opcode **OP\_66** would be ignored by the indexer (since Ordinals intentionally treated even-tagged fields as invalid). One coder’s misadventure with OP\_66 likely yielded a cursed inscription that later got numbered like *-66* – hence cursed inscription -66 stands as a representative of that class. Similarly, people found that if they jammed **two inscriptions into one Bitcoin transaction**, the second one confused the indexer and ended up “cursed.” The first notable instance of this kind might have been an efficient batch mint that produced inscriptions -1024 and -1025 in one go (the indexer, reading sequentially, freaked out after the first and cursed the rest).

As news spread, a *“cursed rush”* ensued. Ordinal enthusiasts began **minting hundreds of cursed inscriptions on purpose**, treating the negative numbers like a new limited-edition series. Their assumption: because these were unintentional and would soon be fixed, having a low negative inscription (say -1 to -10000) might be historically valuable. By early May 2023, Telegram and Discord groups were buzzing with coordination to hit milestone cursed numbers. Within days, the count of known cursed inscriptions (once indexing was tweaked to tally them) approached -10,000. People were deliberately inscribing everything from flipped images of existing Ordinals (to give a “shadow” or evil twin feel) to outright sinister-themed art. For instance, some inscribers took an Ordinal Punk image, inverted its colors or added devil horns, and specifically timed it to land as inscription *-666* – a playful nod to the “number of the beast.” While the exact content of inscription -666 might vary (reports differ), the community narrative is that it’s an **“Inferno Punk”** or similarly devilish image, forever marked by its cursed triple-six ID in the Ordinals registry.

Cursed inscriptions quickly developed their own folklore and subculture. Collectors boasted about snagging *“a three-digit negative”* or a *“cursed Pepe”*. In fact, popular NFT collections got in on the fun: **Bitcoin Punks, Inscribed Pepes, Doge Punks,** and others all intentionally created some cursed entries to spice up their sets. For example, Inscribed Pepes launched with 69 “normal” images, but rumor has it a few extra Pepes were inscribed using cursed methods so that they ended up with negative numbers (imagine a Pepe # -45, lurking unseen for a while). These became Easter eggs for dedicated collectors once wallets started recognizing them. Some cursed items were pure happenstance – e.g., the Ordinals docs example code would itself have resulted in a cursed inscription if executed, as a dev pointed out humorously. It’s as if even the documentation unknowingly held a curse!

By mid-2023, the Ordinals development team prepared to exorcise these ghosts. The solution came in June with the **Ordinals v0.6.0 update**, nicknamed the *“Jubilee.”* Activated at block #\[\[Block824544]] (commonly cited around block 824,744), this update decreed that going forward, inscriptions that would have been cursed (due to the known edge cases) would instead be “**blessed**” with normal positive numbers. In other words, after the Jubilee height, no new negative inscriptions would be created – the protocol would assign them proper IDs automatically. However, crucially, all existing cursed inscriptions (up to that block) would *retain their negative numbering*. The community cheered this compromise: it preserved the special aura (and numbering) of the \~71,000 already cursed items, locking in their status as a quirky historical anomaly, but ensured no infinite proliferation beyond that point. The cursed set was capped and canonized.

One fascinating story around the Jubilee involved a **mysterious Ordinal puzzle**. In January 2024, post-Jubilee, an inscription (#55,365,041) appeared with a cryptic text referencing “10,000 sats… cursed at heart” and pointing to a parent-child series of other inscriptions. Investigators found it linked to an earlier cursed image of a dark **tower (obelisk) – Inscription -471,460** – and a “parent” positive inscription showing a white door in a black arch (#53,383,387). This seemed like an art project leveraging the cursed concept: the door (parent) and tower (child) imagery, combined with the riddle text, created a scavenger hunt bridging cursed and normal inscriptions. It captured the imagination of Ordinals fans and highlighted how curses had gone from bug to **lore**. Even after the Jubilee “blessed” the future, creators found ways to reference and play with the cursed motif in new inscriptions – a lasting legacy of the glitch-turned-meme.

In summary, what started as a simple indexing error gave birth to a mini-era of *cursed Ordinals folklore*. Within a few weeks in 2023, cursed inscriptions went from non-entities to some of the most talked-about mints on Bitcoin. They introduced a **negative zone** in an otherwise positive-numbered world, adding a dash of mystery and mischief to the Ordinals story. And like all good folklore, the tale came with a moral: even in the meticulously ordered realm of Bitcoin, cracks can appear – and when they do, a creative community will rush in to fill them with art, memes, and meaning, making the unintended unforgettable.

### Trivia

* **Why “Cursed”?** The term “cursed” began as developer slang on Discord, jokingly referring to inscriptions that “didn’t get a number and are thus cursed to wander” unrecognized. It stuck, and even the official Ordinals documentation adopted the phrasing *“cursed inscriptions are numbered starting at negative one, counting down.”*. In contrast, once the fix was in place, new edge-case inscriptions were called *“blessed”* – as they would be welcomed into the positive numbering fold.
* **Negative Numbers in Practice:** The Ordinals index assigns negative IDs in the order the problematic inscriptions were mined. That means *-1* is the earliest unindexed inscription, *-2* the next, and so on. By the time of the Jubilee upgrade, over 71,000 such cursed inscriptions had accumulated. Interestingly, the count included both accidental and **intentional** creations – yet there’s no on-chain distinction between an inadvertent cursed inscription and one made deliberately. They’re all just numbers below zero.
* **Market for Curses:** Before wallets fully supported sending cursed inscriptions, trading them was tricky (since many tools didn’t display them). This gave rise to OTC deals in which buyers essentially bought the whole output containing the cursed item. When wallets began recognizing cursed IDs after v0.6.0, a cottage market sprang up. Notably, low negatives (like -1, -2, -3) became ultra-collectible. One collector reportedly paid a hefty premium for Inscription -1, purely for bragging rights of owning “the first cursed inscription.”
* **Even vs Odd Opcodes:** Ordinals follows Bitcoin script’s convention: odd-numbered optional fields are ignored if unrecognized (harmless), but even-numbered ones are treated as errors (reserved for future). Cursed makers abused this by using an undefined even tag (like OP\_66). This created inscriptions that were *valid in Bitcoin’s eyes (the data was in the chain)* but *invalid in Ordinals’ index logic*. The developers debated whether to ever “bless” those OP\_66 inscriptions; as of late 2023, they remained cursed/unbound, because allowing them might break the model of each inscription being tied to a specific satoshi.
* **Teleburn and Recurse:** A few cursed inscriptions came from experiments like “teleburning,” where someone tried to destroy an Ethereum NFT and inscribe a reference to it on Bitcoin. If done incorrectly, these inscriptions could end up cursed (since they might include unexpected metadata formats). In one notable case, a user teleburned a CryptoPunk to Bitcoin – the resulting Ordinal was initially cursed due to an odd content-type quirk. It was later indexed properly after tweaks, but for a while that Punk lived in purgatory, viewable only by directly querying the txid.



## Rise of Recursive Inscriptions: Composability on Bitcoin

### Synopsis

Ordinals began with self-contained inscriptions, but soon developers unlocked **recursion** – the ability for one inscription to call data from another. This storyline chronicles the rise of recursive inscriptions and how they transformed Bitcoin into a composable platform. We highlight key breakthroughs: the discovery of a “hidden” recursive inscription (a classic *Rickroll* Easter egg as Inscription 12992), the formalization of recursion with the BRC-69 standard in July 2023, and pioneering projects that leveraged it. Examples include OnChainMonkey’s 10k collection (which used recursion to reuse trait files), a fully on-chain **music engine** that generates songs from prompts, and the impressive **SNES emulator** split into parts. These milestones show how recursion shattered the 4 MB limit and enabled complex, interlinked creations on Bitcoin – effectively bringing the **Lego-like composability** of Ethereum to the Ordinals ecosystem, but in a uniquely Bitcoin way.

### Narrative

By mid-2023, Ordinals had already proven that art and games could live on-chain, but they still had a limitation: each inscription was **self-contained**. If you wanted to use the same image or code in 10 different inscriptions, you had to duplicate that data 10 times, bloating storage and fees. Enter **recursive inscriptions** – a game-changer that brought the principle of composability (familiar in smart contract platforms) to Bitcoin. In simple terms, recursion allowed one inscription to **fetch content from another inscription** on-chain, so that common elements could be reused rather than repeated. This innovation supercharged what creators could do within Bitcoin’s constraints.

The seed of the idea was actually planted unwittingly by a prank. In February 2023, Inscription 12992 appeared to contain a simple HTML page that – when viewed – would load an audio of Rick Astley’s *“Never Gonna Give You Up.”* Essentially, it was a **Rickroll** hidden in the blockchain. How? The inscription’s code called out to another inscription’s content (where the song data presumably resided) – a trick that functioned because ordinal viewers began supporting a special path like `/-/content/<inscription_id>` to reference on-chain data. This was the first known *ad hoc* recursive inscription (though at the time, not formally recognized as such). A blockchain sleuth later noted: *“Inscription 12992 – created Feb 7, 2023 – was the first ever valid recursive inscription I found… Bitcoin’s never gonna give you up!”*. The Ordinals community had unknowingly been Rickrolled via recursion.

Developers quickly realized the broader implications. If an inscription could pull in data from another, then complex projects could be split into parts. On June 10, 2023, Casey Rodarmor and others officially introduced recursion support in Ordinals (pre-release), and the syntax `/<inscription_id>/content` became standard. This coincided with the release of the **BRC-69** standard in early July 2023, which provided a template for how to create *“recursive collections.”* Under BRC-69, one could inscribe a base JSON that defines traits and references trait-image inscriptions, rather than inscribing each combination separately. The effect was dramatic: a collection of thousands of NFTs could shrink its total data footprint by referencing a small library of shared trait files. This was immediately put into practice by projects like **OnChainMonkey (OCM) Genesis** and others.

OnChainMonkey deserves special mention. OCM had a 10,000-piece profile-picture collection originally on Ethereum. In 2023 they decided to migrate it entirely to Bitcoin Ordinals. Using recursion, the team inscribed the necessary *trait images* (backgrounds, monkey bodies, eyes, hats, etc.) exactly once, then inscribed each monkey NFT as a tiny text file that simply calls those pieces and composes them. In August 2023, OCM successfully inscribed all 10,000 monkeys using fewer than 350 inscriptions (as opposed to 10,000 separate images). This was hailed as *the first 10k collection on Bitcoin*, made possible only by recursion. The inscription around #20,219 was referenced as containing the entire set’s generative data. Moreover, they deliberately inscribed OCM on **Block 9 sats** (the oldest coins in circulation from Hal Finney’s block) for added provenance. OCM’s creative use of recursion demonstrated a **90%+ data size reduction** compared to naive approaches, unlocking scalability for Ordinal collections.

Recursion didn’t just help with images – it turned Bitcoin into a library repository. Developers began inscribing popular code libraries (like the p5.js graphics framework, three.js for 3D, even entire mini game engines) so that any subsequent inscription could call them instead of embedding the code anew. This **“Ordinals library”** approach meant that complex programs could run on-chain by stitching together multiple pieces. For instance, a 3D art inscription could call the three.js library inscription, drastically cutting down its own byte count. In one case, a project inscribed an entire NES (Nintendo) game ROM as a chunk and then created a player inscription that streams that chunk – effectively enabling on-chain ROM access via recursion.

One headline-grabbing example of recursion’s power was the **“Descent Into Darkness” music engine** in July 2023. Created by a developer named Ratoshi, it consisted of 10 Ordinal inscriptions acting together: a core HTML interface and a set of music/SFX data files. This on-chain app (inscription #55,365,041 in Jan 2024) lets anyone input keywords to generate a retro-style chiptune track on the fly. Under the hood, the app uses recursive calls to pull instrument sounds and music patterns stored in other inscriptions, assembling them into a unique song per user input. Essentially, it’s **algorithmic music composition on Bitcoin**, something inconceivable before recursion due to size limits. When this music engine was announced, Ord.io tweeted excitedly that someone had inscribed a *“fully on-chain music engine using recursion”*. It showcased that Bitcoin could now handle generative content across multiple inscriptions, much like how Ethereum dApps call multiple contracts.

The crown jewel of recursive tech, though, might be the **Pizza Ninja SNES emulator** (Jan 2024). Ninjalerts (a dev team) wanted to preserve classic games on Bitcoin. They inscribed a Super Nintendo emulator by chopping its code into eight pieces (to fit each under \~400 KB) and then having a loader inscription reassemble them via recursive fetches. The result was astounding: by visiting the inscription in a browser, users could actually play Super Mario World or other SNES ROMs entirely from the blockchain, with no external servers. Trevor Owens of Ninjalerts noted, *“We had to split up the file into eight chunks and then combine it with recursion.”* Without recursion, an SNES emulator’s code simply wouldn’t fit in one Bitcoin transaction; with it, they achieved something like a **modular 8-part on-chain program**. This demonstrated that even *applications* (beyond single files) could live on L1 Bitcoin by linking many small pieces.

Recursion has effectively enabled **Bitcoin “Lego blocks.”** Developers now talk about building an on-chain *package manager* where common resources (art assets, code libraries, even datasets like a list of words or chess moves) are inscribed once and referenced endlessly. This composability mirrors the way DeFi on Ethereum reuses smart contracts, but here it’s done through file inclusions on a base layer. Notably, recursive inscriptions still maintain Bitcoin’s security model – all data is verified on-chain and immutable. Some in the Ordinals community even speculate about *“OrdiLSPs”* (ordinal service providers) where entire websites or decentralized apps could be composed of dozens of inscriptions calling each other, essentially turning Bitcoin into a **distributed web host**.

In less than a year since Ordinals launched, recursion has taken Bitcoin from hosting standalone digital artifacts to hosting interconnected systems of content. It’s worth mentioning that recursion also breathed new life into some cursed inscriptions: after the v0.6.0 update, previously unrecognized data like OP\_66 inscriptions could potentially be referenced (though still unbound). In effect, recursion gave purpose to what was once wasted space.

The **rise of recursive inscriptions** is a story of Bitcoin maximalism meeting creativity: using nothing but Bitcoin’s base layer, creators achieved something akin to a rudimentary Internet or operating system. It extends Bitcoin’s utility without any changes to consensus – purely through conventions and clever indexing. If early Ordinals proved Bitcoin could hold art, recursive Ordinals proved Bitcoin could host *entire experiences*. The composability era of Bitcoin has just begun, with recursion as the key that unlocked it.

### Trivia

* **The “It’s OK to be Odd” Rule:** Ordinals’ recursion piggybacks on how Bitcoin script treats unknown opcodes. The protocol follow an *“odd = ignore, even = critical”* rule (borrowed from Lightning Network). The recursive call `OP_0 OP_IF / content / OP_ENDIF` structure was designed to look like a no-op with an **odd tag** so that old nodes would ignore it. This allowed recursion to be introduced without breaking anything – inscriptions just include a snippet that modern parsers recognize as “fetch content” while old ones skip it harmlessly.
* **Rickroll Artifact:** Inscription 12992’s recursive Rickroll was essentially the first *on-chain meme mashup*. It combined a famous meme (Rickrolling) with Ordinals’ nascent tech. After recursion became official, someone inscribed *the entirety of Rick Astley’s music video* split across multiple inscriptions, presumably so one could recursively assemble the video. In effect, Bitcoin has been forever “Rickrolled” in pieces.
* **Gas vs. Fees:** Recursion’s impact on fees is interesting. By reducing duplicate data, it can lower the total bytes inscribed for a project, saving block space overall. However, fetching data from other inscriptions doesn’t incur extra Bitcoin fees at use-time (the fee was paid when those were inscribed). This means once libraries or trait files are on-chain, thousands of inscriptions can reuse them “for free.” Some have called this **“data mining”** – upfront investment in putting data on Bitcoin, then unlimited reuse, which could encourage more creative projects since marginal cost is lower.
* **First Recursive Collection Launch:** On July 12, 2023 (just days after BRC-69 spec), the **Bitcoin Bear Cubs** collection minted using recursion. It inscribed base layers for eyes, noses, etc., and then inscribed 100 cub NFTs that called those traits. The entire collection reportedly fit in \~5 MB total. It was a test case that proved average teams (not just deep-pocketed Yuga) could leverage recursion to save money and space.
* **Limits:** Recursion isn’t *infinite*. The Ordinals indexer currently limits how deep you can nest calls and how much total data can be pulled into one inscription (to prevent runaway scripts). But those limits are high enough (several MB) that for now they haven’t been a bottleneck – e.g., SNES emulator’s \~8-part recursion was well within limits. If someone tried a 100-level recursive art piece that calls an inscription that calls another and so on, the indexer would cut it off for safety. So while cool, you can’t make an endlessly self-referential inscription that eats up an entire terabyte by looping calls – thankfully!
* **Recursive Rarity:** With recursion making it easy to generate collections, some projects introduced the idea of **“recursive rarity.”** For example, a generative art piece might randomly call one of several pattern-inscriptions; some patterns are in low supply on-chain, making them rare when they appear in a piece. The twist is that the rarity comes from how many times a certain inscription is referenced across all pieces. This is a novel concept where an inscription’s content can appear in many artworks, and its “popularity” can determine collectible rarity – something unique to the Ordinals ecosystem.
