The HUD - Visible but only in reverse and heavily dimmed externally - Create a backdoor / easteregg style hotkey code to enter the helmet and view the visor in full visibility, non-mirrored, interactive view where clicking on links will actually do something - taking users on an interactive, educational journey.

I need to generate a list of links and a narrative to take users on a number of different journeys through Ordinals - Some specific to music and sound others with broader Ordinals history or more focussed specific Ordinals or other related material that can be used as appropriate visual content for even more narratives. We can use vermillion.place - an AI Ordinals search engine that searches Ordinal inscriptions by keywords and filetypes.
