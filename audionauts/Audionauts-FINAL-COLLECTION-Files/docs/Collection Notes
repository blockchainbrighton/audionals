Audionauts Collection Notes

LAYER 0
Programmable Pixel Art Background - Needs basic seed logic applied to 
create some deterministic visual traits

Logo Animation + Hat Badge + Music Player  (29 Animated timelines + about 50 badge inscriptions)
(See layer-1-animation-music/badge-links.md)

LAYER 2 - H.U.D. [Currently Empty]

LAYER 3 - Helmet - Used to complete PFP feel and masks the animation to
keep it restricted to only being visible from inside the helmet.
