# Audionaut FX Playground - User Guide

Welcome to the Audional Image FX Playground! This is a unique visual experience designed to bring your digital art and profile pictures (PFPs) to life with stunning, beat-synced visual effects, all framed within a classic Audionaut space helmet.

## âœ¨ Key Features

*   **PFP Showcase**: Your digital image is the star of the show, placed at the center of the experience.
*   **Helmet Overlay**: Your PFP is viewed through the visor of a stylized space helmet, giving it a unique "Audionaut" theme.
*   **Dynamic Visual Effects**: Watch as a pre-programmed sequence of vibrant, glitchy, and colorful effects animates your image.
*   **Synchronized Playback**: The visual effects are perfectly timed to a music track or a beat, creating a compelling audiovisual show.
*   **Animated Title**: A large, dynamic title introduces the experience, smoothly animating away as the main effects begin.

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Playground

The playground is designed to be simple and intuitive.

1.  **Loading**: When you first open the page, it will automatically begin loading the main image and all necessary components. You will see a "Loading image..." message. Please be patient, as this may take a few moments.

2.  **Starting the Show**: To start the visual effects timeline, simply **click anywhere on the main image/helmet area**.

3.  **Watching the Effects**: Once started, a timeline of effects will play automatically. The buttons below the image (`.fx-btns`) represent the different effects in the sequence. They will light up as they are triggered.

4.  **Stopping the Show**: To stop or pause the effects, **click the main image/helmet area again**. The animation will stop, and the title text will reset, ready for you to play it again.

## ðŸ¤” Troubleshooting

*   **"Failed to load image" error appears**: This means the application could not retrieve the source PFP image from its URL. This is usually a temporary network issue or a problem with the image host. Try refreshing the page.
*   **The effects don't play when I click**: Ensure the page has fully loaded (the "Loading..." message is gone). A single click on the image should toggle the playback on and off.

Enjoy the show!
