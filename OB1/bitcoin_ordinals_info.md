# Bitcoin Ordinals Technology Research

## What Are Bitcoin Ordinals?

Bitcoin Ordinals are a method of inscribing data onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each satoshi is assigned a unique serial number based on the order in which it was mined. This system of assigning numbers is known as ordinal theory, which enables each satoshi to be tracked individually.

When data - like images, videos, or text - is inscribed onto a satoshi, it transforms that satoshi into a unique digital asset. The inscription process uses the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin blockchain, making these assets immutable and verifiable.

The Ordinals protocol was launched in January 2023 by developer Casey Rodarmor and has since gained significant traction within the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin Ordinals operate directly on the Bitcoin mainnet, which is inherently different from NFTs on platforms like Ethereum.

## How Do Bitcoin Ordinals Work?

The mechanics behind Bitcoin Ordinals involve two key components:

- **Ordinal assignments:** Each satoshi is given a unique ordinal number based on its mining sequence. The ordinal number enables users to identify and track individual satoshis.

- **Inscriptions:** Users can inscribe data onto these numbered satoshis. The data is stored within the witness portion of a Bitcoin transaction, thanks to updates from the Taproot upgrade in 2021, which enables larger data sizes (up to nearly 4 MB).

This combination enables users to create unique digital assets that inherit the security and immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain. Once inscribed, an ordinal cannot be altered or removed, ensuring its authenticity and permanence.

## Benefits of Bitcoin Ordinals

- **Security:** Leveraging Bitcoin's established Proof of Work consensus mechanism, Ordinals benefit from robust security features that have been tested over more than a decade.

- **Immutability:** Once data is inscribed onto a satoshi, it becomes permanently part of the blockchain, ensuring that ownership and provenance are verifiable and tamper-proof.

- **Scarcity:** With billions of satoshis available, there is significant potential for creating unique and rare digital collectibles.

## Marketplaces for Bitcoin Ordinals

Several marketplaces specialize in buying and selling Bitcoin Ordinals:

- Magic Eden: A multi-chain marketplace that has integrated support for Ordinals.
- Gamma: Features a no-code launchpad for artists to create Ordinals.
- OKX NFT Marketplace: Enables bulk buying and has zero listing fees.
- Unisat: A decentralized application for creating and trading Ordinals.
- Ordinals Market: Provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing Ordinals.

## Technical Significance for Music and Audio

The ability to inscribe data onto satoshis opens up new possibilities for music and audio content on the Bitcoin blockchain:

1. **Direct On-Chain Storage:** Unlike traditional NFTs that often store metadata off-chain with only a pointer on the blockchain, Ordinals can store the actual content directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

2. **Embedded Audio:** The Taproot upgrade allows for larger data sizes (up to nearly 4 MB), making it possible to embed actual audio samples or short music pieces directly within the inscription.

3. **Immutable Attribution:** Once inscribed, the attribution of the music or audio content cannot be altered, providing permanent and verifiable proof of creation and ownership.

4. **Decentralized Distribution:** Music stored as Ordinals doesn't rely on centralized platforms for distribution, potentially creating new models for music distribution and royalties.

5. **Programmable Audio Assets:** The unique identification of each satoshi could potentially allow for programmable audio assets, where sounds could be combined, modified, or triggered based on specific conditions.

This technology represents a significant shift in how digital music can be created, owned, and distributed, with implications for artists' rights, fair attribution, and new economic models for the music industry.
