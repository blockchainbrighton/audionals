# Requirements for Enhanced Interactive Story Experience

## Current Implementation Analysis
- The current implementation is an interactive short story experience called "The Colliders"
- It uses synchronized audio and text to tell a sci-fi narrative about parallel universes and particle collisions
- Audio files include particle-strike (6 files) and particle-stream (3 files) effects
- Text is displayed with timing synchronized to audio events
- The experience ends with a video trailer

## Saga Mode Requirements
1. **Extended Narrative**
   - Deeper storyline with additional plot points and character development
   - 50-100% more content than the standard mode
   - More detailed backstory about the Colliders and their universe

2. **Enhanced Audio Integration**
   - Additional audio files for extended narrative sections
   - More complex audio layering and transitions
   - Longer ambient audio sequences

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Add choice points that allow users to explore different narrative branches
   - Include interactive visual elements that respond to user actions
   - Add subtle interactive audio responses to user engagement

4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - More sophisticated text animations and transitions
   - Additional visual effects synchronized with the narrative
   - Background visual elements that evolve with the story

## EPIC Mode Requirements
1. **Immersive Narrative Experience**
   - Full cinematic storytelling approach
   - Rich, detailed descriptions and dialogue
   - Multiple perspective shifts and narrative layers
   - 100-200% more content than standard mode

2. **Advanced Audio-Visual Integration**
   - Audio visualizer components that respond to sound
   - Dynamic background effects that react to narrative intensity
   - Multiple audio layers with spatial audio effects
   - Synchronized particle effects and animations

3. **Enhanced Interactive Elements**
   - More frequent and meaningful interaction points
   - User actions that significantly impact the narrative flow
   - Interactive visual elements that transform based on story progression
   - Audio elements that respond directly to user interaction

4. **Cinematic Visual Design**
   - Full-screen visual effects
   - Dynamic color schemes that shift with narrative mood
   - Advanced text animations and transitions
   - Particle systems and visual effects for key moments

## Technical Requirements
1. **UI Enhancements**
   - Redesigned interface with mode selection (Standard, Saga, EPIC)
   - Progress indicator for longer experiences
   - Improved text display with better typography and readability
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

2. **Audio System Improvements**
   - More sophisticated audio synchronization system
   - Support for multiple concurrent audio tracks
   - Audio visualization components
   - Dynamic audio mixing based on narrative intensity

3. **Visual System Enhancements**
   - Particle system for visual effects
   - Dynamic background effects
   - Text animation system with more options
   - Support for full-screen effects and transitions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient loading of additional assets
   - Progressive enhancement based on device capabilities
   - Preloading of assets for seamless experience
   - Fallback options for devices with limited capabilities
